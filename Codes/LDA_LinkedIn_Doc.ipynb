Version 4.0: next generation sustainability, deliberate reconfiguring systems depend upon enable thrive long term. new ambition focused less harm, creating socially just, regenerative systems thrive. Another topic often discussed difference ESG sustainability. Traditionally, terms often used interchangeably, important distinctions two.The following definitions come an\\\\xa0MIT article\\\\xa0that shared conference. ESG: “... focused screening companies investments, largely understanding business affected environment social issues (with additional focus whether company good governance place manage risks pressures).”Sustainability: “… much broader idea, focusing company’s role society, creates value managing environmental social impacts (both positive negative), actions affect long range stakeholders.”With distinct definitions ESG sustainability mind, attendees challenged think lost focus ESG broader sustainability. ESG mainly focused disclosures investment, organizations run risk losing sight need actual impact.Some considerations make balancing disclosure impacts outlined detail below.Investors increasingly rely ESG raters rankers making decisions, question posed gone far them. raters rankers advantageous tools, also disadvantages considerations made:Advantages: Sophistication - ESG raters rankers typically use sophisticated methods assess companies\\' sustainability performance, drawing wide range data sources research provide meaningful insights risk opportunities.Leadership buy-in/push - Companies may find ESG raters rankers help build executive support sustainability goals initiatives efforts improve ratings stakeholder perceptions. Disadvantages: ‘Check box’ exercise (reporting reporting’s sake) -ESG disclosure risk becoming box-ticking exercise, rather meaningful effort drive progress sustainability.Resource allocation - Responding ESG raters rankers time-consuming resource-intensive process companies, particularly smaller organisations limited sustainability teams. resources spent disclosure, little left implementing processes drive sustainability.Scores doesn’t reflect actual progress - ESG scores may always accurately reflect company\\'s actual sustainability performance, risk companies may selectively disclose information improve scores. Materiality assessments help bridge gap disclosure impact help inform organizations topics impact also important company’s stakeholders investors. looking a\\\\xa0double materiality\\\\xa0lens, financial importance identified well.
