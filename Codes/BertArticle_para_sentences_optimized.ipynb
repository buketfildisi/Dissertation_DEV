              " ' international monetary fund | april 2018 xithe global economic outlook has continued to improve, as discussed in the april 2018 world economic outlook, with the pace of economic growth picking up and the recovery becoming more synchronized around the world. while still supportive of economic growth, global financial conditions have tightened somewhat since the october 2017 global financial stability report (gfsr). such a tightening reflects primarily the bout of equity volatility in early february and a decline in risky asset prices at the end of march follow-ing concerns about a wider escalation of protectionist measures. short-term risks to financial stability have increased somewhat relative to the previous gfsr, and medium-term risks continue to be elevated. financial vulner-abilities, which have accumulated during years of extremely low rates and volatility, could make the road ahead bumpy and could put growth at risk. indeed, growth-at-risk analysis (described in chapter 3 of the october 2017 gfsr) shows that risks to medium-term economic growth, stemming from easy financial conditions, remain well above historical norms. in advanced economies, stronger growth momentum and the firming of inflation have eased to some extent a key challenge facing central banks: maintain-ing the monetary accommodation required to support the economic recovery while addressing medium-term financial vulnerabilities. but the firming of inflation also brings risks. for example, inflation may pick up faster than currently anticipated, possibly propelled by significant fiscal expansion enacted in the united states. central banks may respond to higher inflation more aggressively than currently expected, which could lead to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. this tightening could spill over to risky asset prices, bank dollar funding markets, and both emerging market economies and low-income countries, as discussed below. to minimize these risks, central banks should continue to normalize monetary policy gradually and communicate their decisions clearly to support the economic recovery.valuations of risky assets are still stretched, with some late-stage credit cycle dynamics emerging, reminiscent of the precrisis period. this makes markets exposed to a sharp tightening in financial conditions, which could lead to a sudden unwinding of risk premi-ums and a repricing of risky assets. moreover, liquidity mismatches and the use of financial leverage to boost returns could amplify the impact of asset price moves on the financial system. although no major disrup-tions were reported during the episode of volatility in early february, market participants should not take too much comfort. investors and policymakers must remain attuned to the risks associated with higher interest rates and greater volatility. policymakers should address financial vulnerabilities by using more actively the micro- and macroprudential tools at their disposal or by enhancing their toolkits as needed—for example, to address risks in the nonbank financial sector. the banking sector has become more resilient since the global financial crisis. however, it is important to ensure that the postcrisis regulatory reform agenda is completed. in advanced economies some weaker banks still need to strengthen their balance sheets, and some institutions operating internationally run dollar liquidity mismatches. a sudden spell of turbulence in financial markets could expose these mismatches and crystallize dollar funding strains. a number of emerging market economies have taken advantage of an extended period of benign exter-nal financial conditions to improve their fundamentals. however, they could be vulnerable to a sudden tight-ening of global financial conditions or spillovers from monetary policy normalization in advanced economies, resulting in an increase in risk aversion and capital flow reversals. the severity of such potential shocks will differ across countries, depending on economic fundamentals and the policy responses to those shocks. although regulators in china have taken steps to address risks stemming from the interconnectedness of the banking and shadow banking sectors, vulnerabili-ties remain high. further regulatory actions are crucial to continue reducing risks in the financial sector. executive summary',\n",

              " 'x international monetary fund | october 2017 near-term risks are lower the global financial system continues to strengthen in response to extraordinary policy support, regulatory enhancements, and the cyclical upturn in growth. the health of banks in many advanced economies contin-ues to improve, as progress has been made in resolv-ing some weaker banks, while a majority of systemic institutions are adjusting business models and restoring profitability. the upswing in global economic activity, discussed in the october 2017 world economic outlook (weo), has boosted market confidence while reducing near-term threats to financial stability. but beyond these recent improvements, the environment of continuing monetary accommodation—neces-sary to support activity and boost inflation—is also leading to rising asset valuations and higher leverage. financial stability risks are shifting from the bank-ing system toward nonbank and market sectors of the financial system. these developments and risks call for delicately balancing the eventual normalization of monetary policies, while avoiding a further buildup of financial risks outside the banking sector and address-ing remaining legacy problems. the two sides of monetary policy normalization the baseline path for the global economy, envisaged by central banks and financial markets, foresees continued support from accommodative monetary policies, as inflation rates are expected to recover only slowly. thus, the gradual process of normalizing monetary policies is likely to take several years. too fast a pace of nor-malization would remove needed support for sustained recovery and desired increases in core inflation across major economies. unconventional monetary policies and quantitative easing have forced substantial portfolio adjustments in the private sector and across borders, making the adjustment of financial markets much less predictable than in previous cycles. abrupt or ill-timed shifts could cause unwanted turbulence in financial markets and reverberate across borders and markets. yet the prolonged monetary support envisaged for the major economies may lead to the buildup of further financial excesses. as the search for yield intensifies, vulnerabilities are shifting to the nonbank sector, and market risks are rising. there is too much money chasing too few yield-ing assets: less than 5 percent ($1.8 trillion) of the cur-rent stock of global investment-grade fixed-income assets yields over 4 percent, compared with 80 percent ($15.8 trillion) before the crisis. asset valuations are becoming stretched in some markets as investors are pushed out of their natural risk habitats, and accept higher credit and liquidity risk to boost returns. at the same time, indebtedness among the major global economies is increasing. leverage in the non-financial sector is now higher than before the global financial crisis in the group of t wenty economies as a whole. while this has helped facilitate the economic recovery, it has left the nonfinancial sector more vul-nerable to changes in interest rates. the rise in leverage has led to a rise in private sector debt service ratios in several of the major economies, despite the low level of interest rates. this is stretching the debt servicing capacity of weaker borrowers in some countries and sectors. debt servicing pressures and debt levels in the private nonfinancial sector are already high in several major economies (australia, canada, china, korea), increasing their sensitivity to tighter financial condi-tions and weaker economic activity. the key challenge confronting policymakers is to ensure that the buildup of financial vulnerabilities is contained while monetary policy remains supportive of the global recovery. otherwise, rising debt loads and overstretched asset valuations could undermine market confidence in the future, with repercussions that could put global growth at risk. this report exam-ines such a downside scenario, in which a repricing of risks leads to sharp increases in credit costs, falling asset prices, and a pullback from emerging markets. the economic impact of this tightening of global financial conditions would be significant (about one-third as severe as the global financial crisis) and more broad-based (global output would fall 1.7 percent relative to the weo baseline with varying cross-coun-try effects). monetary normalization would go into executive summary',\n",

',\n",
              " 'xii international monetary fund | october 2017 global financial stability report: is growth at risk?• emerging market economies should continue to take advantage of supportive external conditions to enhance their resilience, including by continu-ing to strengthen external positions where needed, and reduce corporate leverage where it is high. this would put these economies in a better position to withstand a reduction in capital inflows as a result of monetary normalization in advanced economies or waning global risk appetite. similarly, frontier market and low-income-country borrowers should develop the institutional capacity to deal with risks from the issuance of marketable securities, including formulating comprehensive medium-term debt man-agement strategies. this will enable them to take advantage of broader financial market development and access, while containing the associated risks. in china, the authorities have taken welcome steps to address risks in the financial system, but there is still work to do. vulnerabilities will be difficult to address without slower credit growth. recent policies to improve the risk management and transparency of the banking system and reduce the buildup of maturity and liquidity transformation risks in banks’ shadow credit activities are essential and must continue. how-ever, policies should also target balance sheet vulnera-bilities at weak banks. the government’s commitment to reducing corporate leverage is welcome and should remain a priority as part of a broader effort to insulate the economy against slower credit growth. although significant progress has been made in developing the postcrisis policy response, progress remains uneven across the various sectors, with several design and implementation issues remain-ing outstanding. ensuring that the reform mea-sures are completed and implemented is essential to minimize the likelihood of another disruptive crisis. completing the reform agenda will also allow policymakers to conduct a comprehensive evalua-tion of the impact of the reforms and fine-tune the agreed measures. this will allow them to address any material unintended effects their cumulative implementation might have on the provision of key financial services. this is critical to provide contin-ued assurance that reforms have delivered on their objectives and to stave off emerging pressures to roll back these measures, which would only make the financial system more vulnerable. finally, implementation of structural reforms and supportive fiscal policies (as examined in scenario box 1 of the october 2017 world economic outlook) would lift global growth and generate positive eco-nomic spillovers, reinforcing financial policy efforts. household debt and economic growth chapter 2 examines the short- and medium-term implications for economic growth and financial stability of the past decades’ rise in household debt. the chapter documents large differences in household debt-to-gdp ratios across countries but a common increasing trajec-tory that was moderated but not reversed by the global financial crisis. in advanced economies, with notable exceptions, household debt to gdp increased gradu-ally, from 35 percent in 1980 to about 65 percent in 2016, and has kept growing since the global financial crisis, albeit more slowly. in emerging market econo-mies, the same ratio is still much lower, but increased relatively faster over a shorter period, from 5 percent in 1995 to about 20 percent in 2016. moreover, the rise has been largely unabated in recent years. the chapter finds a trade-off between a short-term boost to growth from higher household debt and a medium-term risk to macroeconomic and financial stability that may result in lower growth, consumption, and employment and a greater risk of banking crises. this trade-off is stronger when household debt is higher and can be attenuated by a combination of good policies, institutions, and regulations. these include appropriate macroprudential and financial sector policies, better financial supervision, less dependence on external financing, flexible exchange rates, and lower income inequality. financial conditions can predict growth the global financial crisis showed policymakers that financial conditions offer valuable information about risks to future growth and provide a basis for targeted preemptive action. chapter 3 develops a new macroeconomic measure of financial stability by link-ing financial conditions to the probability distribution of future gdp growth and applies it to a set of 21 major advanced and emerging market economies. the chapter shows that changes in financial conditions shift the whole distribution of future gdp growth. wider risk spreads, rising asset price volatility, and waning global risk appetite are significant predictors of increased downside risks to growth in the near term, and higher leverage and credit growth provide ',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2019 ix executive summary financial markets have been buffeted by the ebb and flow of trade tensions and growing concerns about the global economic outlook. weakening economic activity and increased downside risks have prompted a shift toward a more dovish stance of monetary policy across the globe, a development that has been accompanied by sharp declines in market yields. as a result, the amount of bonds with negative yields has increased to about $15 trillion. investors now expect interest rates to remain very low for longer than anticipated at the beginning of the year. chapter 1 discusses how investors’ search for yield has left asset prices in some markets overstretched and fostered a further easing in financial conditions since the april 2019 global financial stability report. accommodative monetary policy is supporting the economy in the near term, but easy financial conditions are encouraging financial risk-taking and are fueling a further buildup of vulnerabilities in some sectors and countries. chapter 2 shows that corporate sector vulnerabilities are already elevated in several systemically important economies as a result of rising debt burdens and weakening debt service capacity. in a material economic slowdown scenario, half as severe as the global financial crisis, corporate debt-at-risk (debt owed by firms that are unable to cover their interest expenses with their earnings) could rise to $19 trillion—or nearly 40 percent of total corporate debt in major economies—above crisis levels.very low rates are prompting investors to search for yield and take on riskier and more illiquid assets to generate targeted returns, as discussed in chapter 3. vulnerabilities among nonbank financial institutions are now elevated in 80 percent of economies with systemically important financial sectors (by gdp). this share is similar to that at the height of the global financial crisis. vulnerabilities also remain high in the insurance sector. institutional investors’ search for yield could lead to exposures that may amplify shocks during market stress: similarities in investment funds’ portfolios could magnify a market sell-off, pension funds’ illiquid investments could constrain their ability to play a role in stabilizing markets as they have done in the past, and cross-border investments by life insurers could facilitate spillovers across markets. capital flows to emerging markets have also been spurred by low interest rates in advanced economies (see chapter 4). these inflows of capital have supported additional borrowing: median external debt in emerging market economies has risen to 160 percent of exports from 100 percent in 2008. in some countries, this ratio has increased to more than 300 percent. in the event of a sharp tightening in global financial conditions, increased borrowing could raise rollover and debt sustainability risks. for example, some overindebted state-owned enterprises may find it harder to maintain market access and service their liabilities without sovereign support. the october 2019 global financial stability report at a glance key vulnerabilities in the global financial system rising corporate debt burdens increasing holdings of riskier and more illiquid assets by institutional investors greater reliance on external borrowing by emerging and frontier market economies what should policymakers do? address corporate vulnerabilities with stricter supervisory and macroprudential oversight tackle risks among institutional investors through strengthened oversight and disclosures implement prudent sovereign debt management practices and frameworks',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | april 2019 ixfinancial conditions have tightened since the october 2018 global financial stability report (gfsr) but remain relatively accommodative, notably in the united states. after sharp declines in the fourth quarter of 2018, financial markets rebounded strongly in early 2019 on growing optimism about us-china trade negotiations and as major central banks adopted a more patient and flexible approach to monetary policy normalization. such a dovish shift in the outlook for monetary policy in advanced economies has helped sustain positive market sentiment despite growing signs of weakening global growth (as discussed in the april 2019 world economic outlook). with financial conditions still accommodative, vulnerabilities continue to build. the tightening in financial conditions in the fourth quarter of 2018 was too short-lived to meaningfully slow the buildup of vulnerabilities, leaving medium-term risks to global financial stability broadly unchanged. financial vulnerabilities are currently elevated in the sovereign, corporate, and nonbank financial sectors in several systemic countries. as the credit cycle matures, corporate sector vulnerabilities— which appear elevated in about 70 percent of systemically important countries (by gdp)— could amplify an economic downturn. this report presents a new framework for comprehensive assessment of balance sheet vulnerabilities across financial and nonfinancial sectors, and focuses on a number of specific vulnerabilities in advanced and emerging market economies. corporate sector debt in advanced economies: debt- service capacity has improved in most advanced economies, and balance sheets appear strong enough to sustain a moderate economic slowdown or a gradual tightening of financial conditions. however, overall debt and financial risk taking have increased, and the creditworthiness of some borrowers has deteriorated. as a result, the stock of lower-rated investment-grade (bbb) bonds has quadrupled, and the stock of speculative-grade credits has almost doubled in the united states and the euro area since the crisis. therefore, a significant economic downturn or sharp tightening of financial conditions could lead to a notable repricing of credit risk and could strain the debt-service capacity of indebted firms. if monetary and financial conditions remain easy, debt will likely rise further in the absence of policy action, raising the specter of a deeper downturn in the future. the sovereign–financial sector nexus in the euro area: fiscal challenges in italy have rekindled worries about the sovereign–financial sector nexus. bank capital ratios are now higher in the euro area. but potential losses on nonperforming loans and markto-market declines in the value of government bonds could result in a significant hit to capital for some banks. insurance companies could also become entangled in the nexus, given their significant holdings of sovereign, bank, and corporate bonds. there is a risk that strains in the financial sector could yet again be passed on to companies and households, hurting economic growth. china’s financial imbalances and potential spillovers: financial vulnerabilities in china remain high, and the authorities face a difficult trade-off between supporting near-term growth, countering adverse external shocks, and containing leverage through regulatory tightening. small and medium-size banks remain weak, weighing on financing conditions for smaller firms. yet further monetary and credit easing may increase vulnerabilities, as continued credit growth could slow or impede bank balance sheet repair and exacerbate existing biases in credit allocation. meanwhile, china’s importance for other emerging markets will continue to increase with its inclusion in benchmark indices; portfolio flows to china are expected to rise by as much as $150 billion by 2020 as a result of its inclusion in a global bond index. volatile portfolio flows to emerging markets: portfolio flows to emerging markets are increasingly influenced by benchmark-driven investors. the amount of funds benchmarked against widely followed emerging market bond indices has quadrupled in the past 10 years to $800 billion. estimates also suggest that 70 percent of country allocations of investment funds are influenced by benchmark indi-executive summary',\n",
              " 'x international monetary fund | april 2019 global financial stability report: vulnerabilities in a maturing credit cycleces. given that benchmark-driven investors are more sensitive to changes in global financial conditions than other investors, the benefits of index membership may be tempered by financial stability risks for some countries. as these investors become a larger share of portfolio flows, external shocks may propagate to medium-size emerging and frontier market economies faster than in the past. house prices at risk (har): the recent rapid increase in house prices in many countries has raised concerns about the possibility of a price correction. a new house prices-at-risk framework, presented in chapter 2 of this report, is used to quantify downside risks to house price growth. lower house price momentum, overvaluation, excessive credit growth, and tighter financial conditions help predict downside risks to house prices up to three years ahead. in turn, the measure of house prices at risk helps forecast downside risks to gdp growth and predict financial crises. the most recent data point to increased downside risks to house prices over the next one to three years in some countries. looking ahead, there is a risk that positive investor sentiment could deteriorate abruptly, leading to a sharp tightening of financial conditions. this will have a larger effect on economies with weaker fundamentals, greater financial vulnerabilities, and less policy space to respond to shocks. possible triggers include the following: a sharper-than-expected growth slowdown could lead to tighter financial conditions as risk asset prices fall, reflecting a weaker outlook for corporate earnings, even as policies turn more accommodative. an unexpected shift to a less dovish outlook for monetary policy in advanced economies could trigger a repricing in markets, especially if investors realize that they have taken too benign a view on the monetary policy stance.  political and policy risks, such as an escalation of trade tensions or a no-deal brexit, could affect market sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion. amid rising downside risks to global growth, policymakers should aim to avoid a sharper economic slowdown, while keeping financial vulnerabilities in check: • policymakers should clearly communicate any reassessment of the monetary policy stance that reflects either changes in the economic outlook or risks surrounding the outlook. this will help avoid unnecessary swings in financial markets or unduly compressed market volatility. in countries with high or rising financial vulnerabilities, policymakers should proactively deploy prudential tools or expand their macroprudential toolkits where needed. these countries would benefit from activating or tightening broad-based macroprudential measures, such as countercyclical capital buffers, to increase the financial system’s resilience. efforts should also focus on developing prudential tools to address rising corporate debt from nonbank financial intermediaries and maturity and liquidity mismatches in the nonbank sector. regulators should also ensure that more comprehensive stress tests (that include macro-financial feedback effects) are conducted for banks and nonbank lenders. measures to repair public and private balance sheets should be stepped up. a gradual fiscal adjustment is needed to reduce elevated risks, based on policies that will support medium-term growth. efforts to tackle nonperforming loans on euro area bank balance sheets should continue. given concerns about the sovereign–financial sector nexus, consideration could be given to mitigating concentration risk in banks’ sovereign exposures. emerging market economies should ensure resilience against foreign portfolio outflows by reducing excessive external liabilities, cutting reliance on short-term debt, and maintaining adequate fiscal and foreign exchange reserve buffers. given the rising importance of benchmark-driven portfolio flows, a close dialogue is needed between index providers, the investment community, and regulators. building on the progress achieved so far, the chinese authorities should continue financial sector de-risking and deleveraging policies and put greater emphasis on addressing bank vulnerabilities. structural reforms such as reducing the emphasis on growth targets and tightening budget constraints for chinese stateowned enterprises will be critical to reduce credit misallocation.',\n",
              " ' international monetary fund | october 2023 xi soft landing or abrupt awakening? with core inflation still high and declining only slowly in many advanced economies, central banks may need to keep monetary policy tighter for longer than is currently priced in markets. in emerging market economies, progress on lowering inflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early rate hikes becoming apparent. however, there are discrepancies across regions. widening divergence of inflation and economic outlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of the global monetary policy. yet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, whereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is avoided, has fueled asset valuation since the april 2023 global financial stability report. despite the declines in equity prices since september, driven by rising long-term real rates, financial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net (figure es.1). taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, stock prices in europe and the united states have climbed about 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit spreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of this rate hike cycle. in japan, equities have outperformed other advanced economies, supported in part by continued monetary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. emerging markets such as chile, hungary, india, mexico, and poland have also seen notable equity price increases, consistent with the appreciation of most major emerging market currencies in the first half of the year. upside surprises to the inflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, resulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. while acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, a weak tail of banks remains in some countries. in addition, cracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could turn into worrisome fault lines. in the event of an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could be triggered and again test the resilience of the global financial system. most notably, the global credit cycle has started to turn as borrowers’ debt repayment capacity diminishes and credit growth slows. the imf’s growth-at-risk measure summarizes this assessment, indicating that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in april 2023 (figure es.2). in a scenario wherein the hoped-for soft landing does not materialize, investors pull back from risk taking, and financial conditions tighten toward the long-term average, the growth-at-risk forecasts the growth distribution to be even more firmly skewed to the downside.executive summary united states euro area other advanced economies china emerging markets excluding chinaapr. 2023 gfsrfigure es.1. financial conditions indices (number of standard deviations over a long-term average) source: bloomberg finance l.p. note: gfsr = global financial stability report ; q = quarter.–1.5–1.0–0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 2019:q1 19:q2 19:q3 19:q4 20:q1 20:q2 20:q3 20:q4 21:q1 21:q2 21:q3 21:q4 22:q1 22:q2 23:q1 23:q2 23:q322:q3 22:q4 fifth percentileforecast density for year 2024, at 2023:q3 ~100 basis pointsforecast density for year 2024, at 2023:q3 (excluding credit information)scenario: ﬁnancial conditions correct to long-term average levelfigure es.2. global growth at risk (probability density of global growth in 2024) sources: bloomberg finance l.p.; and imf staff calculations. note: q = quarter.00.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.40 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 global growth rate (percent) ratio <1× ratio >1 and <1.5× ratio >1.5 and <2×figure es.3. corporate cash-to-interest-expense ratios in emerging markets excluding china (percent) sources: bloomberg finance l.p.; and imf staff calculations. note: cash includes cash and cash equivalents. interest expense includes those on loans and bonds; q = quarter.0100 102030405060708090 medium ﬁrms cash-to-interest-expense ratiolarge ﬁrms small ﬁrmsshare in total outstanding debt of the group 2019: q121:q1 23:q1 2019: q121:q1 23:q1 2019: q121:q1 23:q1',\n",

higher interest rates reduce the value of their fixed-income assets. those using leveraged investment strategies predicated on swift disinflation may be forced to unwind positions should inflation stay doggedly high. chapter 3 shows that, by 2030, climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies (emdes) are estimated to reach about $2 trillion per year. the private sector is key to financing the required investments in emdes, given limited fiscal space and challenging market conditions. by 2030, the share of private finance must increase to about 80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in emdes, and the proportion should be even greater in emdes outside of china (figure es.8). policy recommendations ultimately, sustainable economic growth requires both price and financial stability. central banks must remain determined in their fight against inflation until there is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably toward targets, although the stance of monetary policy should reflect a country-specific pace of economic recovery and disinflationary processes. communication remains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. progress on inflation in a number of emerging market economies has been notable, but central banks should be cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. countries should integrate their policies, including, where applicable, within the integrated policy framework, the imf’s macrofinancial framework for countries to manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows amid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the foreign exchange environment. optimal policy combinations depend on the nature of the shock and countryspecific characteristics. any response measures should be part of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and allows for needed adjustments. sovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, frontier markets, and low-income countries should strengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue with creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support from the international community. if applicable, the group of t wenty common framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, including in preemptive restructurings. bilateral and private sector creditors should find ways to coordinate preemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly hard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. where feasible, refinancing or liability management operations should be executed to rebuild buffers. in china, robust policies to restore confidence in the real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of negative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, and local governments. priority should be given to facilitating the completion of housing projects, which could stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and the timely resolution and restructuring of troubled property developers. easing monetary policy further and reorienting fiscal support toward households are necessary to support economic growth. a comprehensive strategy is needed to address the lgfv debt issue to restore lgfvs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve sustainable levels of local government debt. although authorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate systemic risks emanating from the asset management sector, further progress is needed to address risky exposures to real estate and lgfvs and liquidity mismatches between their assets and liabilities. for banks, maintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing out forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss recognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak banks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. the sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial system and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions highlights the urgent need to implement international standards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, assess whether specific features of these standards performed as intended during the recent turmoil, and enhance supervision where necessary. adequate minimum capital and liquidity requirements across large and small institutions alike are essential to contain financial stability risks. authorities should be more prepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in banks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to access central bank facilities, and strengthening where needed their bank resolution regimes and preparedness to deploy them. national authorities should deploy stringent stress tests to estimate the potential effects of diminished borrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline in

              " 'xii international monetary fund | april 2023 a financial system tested by higher inflation and interest rates financial stability risks have risen significantly as the resilience of the global financial system has faced a number of severe tests since the october 2022 global financial stability report. in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, amid extremely low interest rates, compressed volatility, and ample liquidity, market participants increased their exposures to liquidity, duration, and credit risk, often employing financial leverage to boost returns—vulnerabilities repeatedly flagged in previous issues of the global financial stability report. the sudden failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank in the united states, and the loss of market confidence in credit suisse, a global systemically important bank (gsib) in europe, have been a powerful reminder of the challenges posed by the interaction between tighter monetary and financial conditions and the buildup in vulnerabilities. amplified by new technologies and the rapid spread of information through social media, what initially appeared to be isolated events in the us banking sector quickly spread to banks and financial markets across the world, causing a sell-off of risk assets (figure es.1). it also led to a significant repricing of monetary policy rate expec-tations, with magnitude and scale comparable to that of black monday in 1987 (figure es.2). the forceful response by policymakers to stem systemic risks reduced market anxiety. in the united states, bank regulators took steps to guarantee uninsured deposits at the two failed institutions and to provide liquidity through a new bank term funding program to prevent further bank runs. in switzerland, the swiss national bank provided emergency liquidity support to credit suisse, which was then taken over by ubs in a state-supported acquisition. but market sentiment remains fragile, and strains are still evident across a number of institutions and markets, as investors reassess the fundamental health of the financial system. the fundamental question confronting market participants and policymakers is whether these recent events are a harbinger of more systemic stress that will test the resilience of the global finan cial system—a canary in the coal mine—or simply the isolated manifestation of challenges from tighter monetary and financial conditions after more than a decade of ample liquidity. while there is little doubt that the regulatory changes implemented since the global financial crisis, especially at the largest banks, have made the financial system generally more resilient, concerns remain about vulnerabilities that may be hidden, not just at banks but also at nonbank financial intermediaries (nbfis). s&p 500 silicon valley bank financial groupus banks euro stoxx 600 credit suisseeuropean banksfigure es.1. performance of us and european equities (prices, indexed, may 1, 2022 = 100) 020406080100120 may 2022 aug. 2022 nov. 2022 feb. 2023 source: bloomberg finance l.p. black mondaylong-term capital management subprime crisis silicon valley bank and signature bankfigure es.2. us near-term policy rate expectations (basis points) –150–100–50050100 sources: bloomberg finance l.p.; and imf staff calculations. note: estimated using near-term money market forward with a maturity of around 9 months.1986 89 92 95 98 2001 04 07 10 13 16 19 22 assets > 500 billion assets between 100 billion to 500 billionfigure es.3. share of uninsured deposits versus equity impact of mark-to-market losses of select us banks (percentage points of cet1 ratio) cet1 ratio impact of afs/htm losses (percentage points) –13–9 –11–7–5–3–1 sources: federal reserve; and imf staff calculations. note: afs = available for sale; cet1 = common equity tier 1; htm = held to maturity. 0 20 40 60 80 100 share of uninsured deposits (percent)silicon valley banksignature bank ofnew yorkexecutive summary 30082_00_fm.indd  12 09/04/2023  11:29 pm',\n",

              " 'executive summary  international monetary fund | april 2021 xia more granular firm-level assessment finds that there are notable differences in performance across sectors and firm sizes. imf staff analysis suggests that liquidity stress is high at small firms in most sectors and across countries, while solvency stress is high at small firms but also notable at mid-sized and even large firms in the most affected sectors (figure 9). chapter 1 proposes a framework to assess whether firms should rely on market financing, seek government support, or be restructured or liquidated. the crisis has hit the commercial real estate sector hard (see chapter\\xa03). commercial property transactions and prices slumped in 2020 (figure 10). part of the adverse impact on the retail, office, and hotel segments could be structural, as some activities increasingly take place virtually or are relocating outside of large cities. in the event of a structural decline in demand, commercial real estate fair values could drop sharply: a permanent increase in the vacancy rate by 5 percentage points is estimated to result, on average, in a drop in fair values by about 15 percent after five years (figure 11). since the pandemic, price misalignments appear to have increased. this development, if it persists, could pose downside risks to growth. banks came into the pandemic with high capital and liquidity buffers, thanks to regulatory reforms implemented after the 2007–08 financial crisis, and they have been resilient so far. but the extent to which they will continue to provide credit through the recovery is an open question. while growth of loans, particularly to businesses, has slowed in some countries, loan demand is expected to firm up once the recovery gains strength, especially where it has been weakest. but loan officers in most countries do not anticipate a loosening in lending standards (figure\\xa012). the phasing out of support policies could have a significant impact on some banks, likely weighing on their appetite for lending. moreover, for most banks, uncertainties about credit losses and weak prospects for profitability are likely to discourage significant reduction in capital buffers to support the recovery. such constraints may be particularly worrisome for firms with limited financing options that are more dependent on bank credit. authorities should continue to encourage banks to use buffers, where prudent, to support the recovery. ongoing policy support remains essential until a sustainable and inclusive recovery takes hold to maintain the flow of credit to the economy and prevent the pandemic from posing a threat to the global financial system. monetary policy will need to remain accommodative until mandated policy objectives are achieved. policymakers should act swiftly to prevent financial vulnerabilities from becoming entrenched and turning into legacy problems. contribution of debt contribution of gdp leverage increase sources: institute of international finance (iif); and imf staff calculations. note: aes = advanced economies; ems = emerging markets.014 12 10 8 6 4 2 global aes emsfigure 7. nonﬁnancial corporate debt change (percentage points of gdp, 2019:q4 to 2020:q3) united states europe sources: morgan stanley; and imf staff.030 25 20 15 10 5 2004 06 08 12 14 16 10 18 20figure 8. median us and european high-yield issuer cash (percent of debt) sectors in the bottom quartile (least affected) median sector sectors in the top quartile (most affected)figure 9. solvency stress indicators (share of debt at ﬁrms with elevated solvency stress in percent of total debt at all ﬁrms in respective segments) sources: s&p capital iq; and imf staff. note: large, mid-sized, and small ﬁrms are deﬁned by total assets. 070 60 50 40 30 20 10 large mid-sized small large mid-sized small advanced economies emerging market economies',\n",
              " 'global financial stability report: preempting a legacy of vulnerabilitiesxii international monetary fund | april 2021taking into consideration possible lags between the activation and impact of macroprudential tools, policymakers should take early action. they should tighten selected macroprudential policy tools to tackle pockets of elevated vulnerability while avoiding a broad tightening of financial conditions. if such tools are not available (such as in some segments of the nonbank financial intermediation sector), policymakers should swiftly develop them. given the challenges to designing and operationalizing macroprudential tools within existing frameworks, policymakers should also consider building buffers elsewhere to protect the financial system. in emerging and frontier market economies, countries with market access should take advantage of favorable financing conditions to improve the composition of their debt structure. countries with limited market access will likely need additional assistance from the international community. other countries facing significant difficulties with debt burdens could benefit from deeper restructuring. the group of t wenty (g20) common framework for debt t reatments can help address debt vulnerabilities. rebuilding buffers, where possible, should be a key priority to prepare for any sudden price adjustments and reversal of capital flows. repairing corporate balance sheets should be a priority to enable a sustainable and inclusive recovery. direct and firm-specific targeted policy support may be needed for viable firms whose market access is limited and that are facing temporary liquidity or solvency risks. given very limited fiscal resources in some jurisdictions, policymakers should also expedite reforms to enhance resolution frameworks, including the development of distressed debt and nonperforming loan markets. once the extent of structural changes in the commercial real estate sector becomes clearer, targeted macroprudential policy tools (such as limits on the loan-to-value or debt-service-coverage ratios) should be deployed to reduce downside risks to growth. the optimal timing of such policy measures should depend on the economy-specific pace of the recovery and the degree of financial vulnerabilities in the commercial real estate sector. broadening the macroprudential toolkit to cover nonbank financial institutions active in some commercial real estate funding markets will also be crucial. in the financial sector, regulatory guidance on provisioning for expected losses to avoid excessive procyclicality remains pertinent, but such provisioning should be subject to supervisory scrutiny. restrictions on capital distributions should be maintained or be relaxed only progressively in countries overcoming the pandemic, subject to supervisory stress tests to ensure that banks remain well capitalized.interquartile range medianfigure 11. response of commercial real estate prices across economies to a permanent shock to the vacancy rate (percent) sources: haver analytics; msci real estate; and imf staff calculations. note: see chapter 3 for background. t denotes quarter of shock.–70–50 –60–30 –4020 10 0 –10 –20 t + 0y +1 year +2 years +3 years +4 years +5 years figure 12. small and medium firm lending standards and loan demand expected (standard deviations) source: imf staff calculations. note: countries are identiﬁed by three-letter international organization for standardization (iso) country codes. expected refers to next 3 months. green dots = advanced economies; yellow dots = emerging markets; ea = euro area; sme = small and medium enterprises.–22 1 0 –1 easing sme lending standards (expected 2021:q1)tighteningweaksme demand (expected 2021:q1) strong –2 –1 0 1 2 3eamarket tight market loose gbrdeuita espirl pol rusczehun tur phlthanzlbramex fraunited states europe latest source: green street advisors. note: latest data available are for january 2021 in europe and february 2021 in the united states.–3020 15 10 5 0 –5 –10 –15 –20 –25 all retail ofﬁce industrialfigure 10. commercial real estate prices (percent, 2020:q2 and latest, year over year)',\n",

              " 'global financial stability report: bridge to recoveryxii international monetary fund | october 2020confronted with a global health and economic crisis, policymakers have taken extraordinary measures to protect people, the economy, and the financial system. however, prospects for recovery remain highly uncertain and will depend on the availability of reliable covid-19 treatments and vaccines. in addition, many countries have entered the crisis with elevated preexisting vulnerabilities in some sectors—asset management, nonfinancial firms, and sovereigns—and vulnerabilities are rising, representing potential headwinds for the recovery (figure 1). since the june 2020 global financial stability update, global financial conditions have remained accommodative on the back of continued policy support. in advanced economies, low interest rates and a recovery in risk asset markets have continued to support further easing in financial conditions (figure 2). financial conditions have generally eased also in emerging markets (excluding china) over the same period, although external costs for many countries are still above pre–covid-19 levels (figure 2). in china, financial conditions have remained broadly stable, as authorities have scaled back expectations for further interest rate reductions amid improving economic activity and rising financial sector risks. although the sharp easing of financial conditions since late march has helped prevent a financial crisis and cushion the impact of covid-19 on the economy, the deterioration of the economic outlook has shifted the expected distribution of global growth in 2020 deeply into negative territory (figure 3). looking ahead, the global economy is expected to grow by 5.2 percent in 2021, according to the october 2020 world economic outlook (weo). this expected rebound and easy financial conditions imply that the odds of negative growth next year are low, though the balance of risks is tilted to the downside (figure 3). unprecedented policy actions taken in response to the pandemic have been successful in boosting investor sentiment and maintaining the flow of credit to the economy. to cope with cash flow pressures, firms have stepped up bond issuance, tapped bank credit lines (most notably in the united states), and taken advantage of government-guaranteed loans (see chapter 3). hard currency bond issuance in emerging markets has been strong as well. aggregate portfolio flows have recovered from their march lows, though about half of emerging market economies have continued to experience outflows over the past three months. easy financial conditions have improved the outlook for portfolio flows to emerging markets, with the probability of oct. 2020 gfsr apr. 2020 gfsr global ﬁnancial crisisnonﬁnancial ﬁrms (21)asset managers (11) insurers (12)more vulnerable banks (12)households (16)sovereigns (12)other ﬁnancial institutions (16)10080604020sources: bank for international settlements; haver analytics; national authorities; standard & poor’s; wind information co.; and imf staff calculations. note: based on 29 jurisdictions with systemically important ﬁnancial sectors (see chapter 1 for details). “global ﬁnancial crisis” reﬂects the maximum 2007–08 vulnerability value. gfsr = global financial stability report.figure 1. proportion of systemically important countries with elevated vulnerabilities, by sector (percent of countries with high and medium-high vulnerabilities, by gdp or assets; number of vulnerable countries in parentheses) figure 3. near-term global growth forecast densities (probability densities) sources: bank for international settlements; bloomberg finance l.p.; haver analytics; imf, international financial statistics database; and imf staff calculations. note: forecast density estimates are centered around the respective world economic outlook forecasts for 2020 and 2021. given the unprecedented nature of the current crisis, model-based growth-at-risk estimates are inevitably subject to larger-than-usual uncertainty bounds.0.000.050.100.150.200.250.35 0.30 density for year 2020: at 2020:q2density for year 2020: at 2020:q1 fifth percentilesdensity for year 2021: at 2020:q3probability density –12 –10 –8 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 global growth rate (percent) em external costs interest ratescorporate valuations indexhouse pricesfigure 2. key drivers of global financial conditions indices (standard deviations from mean) dec. mar. june sep.dec. mar. june sep.dec. mar. june sep.dec. mar. june sep.dec. mar. june sep. sources: bank for international settlements; bloomberg finance l.p.; haver analytics; imf, international financial statistics database; and imf staff calculations. note: higher number indicates a tightening of ﬁnancial conditions. see chapter 1 for details. em = emerging market.–1.0–0.50.00.51.01.52.5 2.0united states euro area other advancedchina other emerging',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2023 xi soft landing or abrupt awakening? with core inflation still high and declining only slowly in many advanced economies, central banks may need to keep monetary policy tighter for longer than is currently priced in markets. in emerging market economies, progress on lowering inflation appears to be more advanced, with the benefits of early rate hikes becoming apparent. however, there are discrepancies across regions. widening divergence of inflation and economic outlook could mark the beginning of the desynchronization of the global monetary policy. yet, optimism about a soft landing of the global economy, whereby disinflation continues apace and a recession is avoided, has fueled asset valuation since the april 2023 global financial stability report. despite the declines in equity prices since september, driven by rising long-term real rates, financial conditions for advanced economies have eased on net (figure es.1). taking a slightly longer view, so far this year, stock prices in europe and the united states have climbed about 10 and 12 percent, respectively, and corporate credit spreads remain near the lowest levels since the beginning of this rate hike cycle. in japan, equities have outperformed other advanced economies, supported in part by continued monetary policy accommodation and stronger corporate profits. emerging markets such as chile, hungary, india, mexico, and poland have also seen notable equity price increases, consistent with the appreciation of most major emerging market currencies in the first half of the year. upside surprises to the inflation outlook would challenge this soft-landing narrative, resulting in a potentially sharp repricing of assets. while acute stress in the global banking system has subsided, a weak tail of banks remains in some countries. in addition, cracks in other sectors may also become apparent and could turn into worrisome fault lines. in the event of an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, adverse feedback loops could be triggered and again test the resilience of the global financial system. most notably, the global credit cycle has started to turn as borrowers’ debt repayment capacity diminishes and credit growth slows. the imf’s growth-at-risk measure summarizes this assessment, indicating that risks to global growth are skewed to the downside, similar to the assessment in april 2023 (figure es.2). in a scenario wherein the hoped-for soft landing does not materialize, investors pull back from risk taking, and financial conditions tighten toward the long-term average, the growth-at-risk forecasts the growth distribution to be even more firmly skewed to the downside.executive summary united states euro area other advanced economies china emerging markets excluding chinaapr. 2023 gfsrfigure es.1. financial conditions indices (number of standard deviations over a long-term average) source: bloomberg finance l.p. note: gfsr = global financial stability report ; q = quarter.–1.5–1.0–0.50.00.51.01.52.02.5 2019:q1 19:q2 19:q3 19:q4 20:q1 20:q2 20:q3 20:q4 21:q1 21:q2 21:q3 21:q4 22:q1 22:q2 23:q1 23:q2 23:q322:q3 22:q4 fifth percentileforecast density for year 2024, at 2023:q3 ~100 basis pointsforecast density for year 2024, at 2023:q3 (excluding credit information)scenario: ﬁnancial conditions correct to long-term average levelfigure es.2. global growth at risk (probability density of global growth in 2024) sources: bloomberg finance l.p.; and imf staff calculations. note: q = quarter.00.050.100.150.200.250.300.350.40 –6 –4 –2 0 2 4 6 8 global growth rate (percent) ratio <1× ratio >1 and <1.5× ratio >1.5 and <2×figure es.3. corporate cash-to-interest-expense ratios in emerging markets excluding china (percent) sources: bloomberg finance l.p.; and imf staff calculations. note: cash includes cash and cash equivalents. interest expense includes those on loans and bonds; q = quarter.0100 102030405060708090 medium ﬁrms cash-to-interest-expense ratiolarge ﬁrms small ﬁrmsshare in total outstanding debt of the group 2019: q121:q1 23:q1 2019: q121:q1 23:q1 2019: q121:q1 23:q1',\n",

higher interest rates reduce the value of their fixed-income assets. those using leveraged investment strategies predicated on swift disinflation may be forced to unwind positions should inflation stay doggedly high. chapter 3 shows that, by 2030, climate mitigation investment needs in emerging market and developing economies (emdes) are estimated to reach about $2 trillion per year. the private sector is key to financing the required investments in emdes, given limited fiscal space and challenging market conditions. by 2030, the share of private finance must increase to about 80 percent of climate mitigation investment needs in emdes, and the proportion should be even greater in emdes outside of china (figure es.8). policy recommendations ultimately, sustainable economic growth requires both price and financial stability. central banks must remain determined in their fight against inflation until there is tangible evidence that it is moving sustainably toward targets, although the stance of monetary policy should reflect a country-specific pace of economic recovery and disinflationary processes. communication remains crucial to convey policymakers’ resolve. progress on inflation in a number of emerging market economies has been notable, but central banks should be cautious not to ease policy rates too aggressively. countries should integrate their policies, including, where applicable, within the integrated policy framework, the imf’s macrofinancial framework for countries to manage the risks stemming from volatile capital flows amid uncertainty in global monetary policy and the foreign exchange environment. optimal policy combinations depend on the nature of the shock and countryspecific characteristics. any response measures should be part of a plan that tackles underlying macroeconomic imbalances and allows for needed adjustments. sovereign borrowers in emerging market economies, frontier markets, and low-income countries should strengthen efforts to contain risks associated with their high debt vulnerabilities, including through dialogue with creditors, multilateral cooperation, and support from the international community. if applicable, the group of t wenty common framework—a reformed quicker and more effective version—should be used, including in preemptive restructurings. bilateral and private sector creditors should find ways to coordinate preemptive and orderly restructuring to avoid costly hard defaults and prolonged loss of market access. where feasible, refinancing or liability management operations should be executed to rebuild buffers. in china, robust policies to restore confidence in the real estate sector will be critical to limit the risk of negative spillovers to the financial sector, corporations, and local governments. priority should be given to facilitating the completion of housing projects, which could stem the slump in homebuyer sentiment, and the timely resolution and restructuring of troubled property developers. easing monetary policy further and reorienting fiscal support toward households are necessary to support economic growth. a comprehensive strategy is needed to address the lgfv debt issue to restore lgfvs’ debt-servicing capacity and achieve sustainable levels of local government debt. although authorities have taken steps in recent years to mitigate systemic risks emanating from the asset management sector, further progress is needed to address risky exposures to real estate and lgfvs and liquidity mismatches between their assets and liabilities. for banks, maintaining adequate loss-absorbing buffers, phasing out forbearance policies that could delay loan-loss recognition, and expediting efforts to restructure weak banks are critical for mitigating financial stability risks. the sizable tail of weak banks in the global financial system and the risk of contagion to healthy institutions highlights the urgent need to implement international standards in a consistent manner across jurisdictions, assess whether specific features of these standards performed as intended during the recent turmoil, and enhance supervision where necessary. adequate minimum capital and liquidity requirements across large and small institutions alike are essential to contain financial stability risks. authorities should be more prepared to intervene early to address weaknesses in banks, including ensuring their banks’ preparedness to access central bank facilities, and strengthening where needed their bank resolution regimes and preparedness to deploy them. national authorities should deploy stringent stress tests to estimate the potential effects of diminished borrowers’ repayment capacity and a sharp decline in

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2018 ixin the 10 years since the global financial crisis, regulatory frameworks have been enhanced and the banking system has become stronger, but new vulnerabilities have emerged, and the resilience of the global financial system has yet to be tested. since the last global financial stability report (gfsr), nearterm risks to global financial stability have increased somewhat, but financial conditions are still broadly accommodative and supportive of growth in the near term. that said, risks could rise sharply should pressures in emerging market economies mount or if trade tensions escalate. meanwhile, medium-term risks remain elevated, as easy financial conditions contribute to a further buildup of financial vulnerabilities. over the past six months, global financial conditions have marginally tightened and the divergence between advanced and emerging market economies has grown. the global economic expansion continues, providing an opportunity to strengthen balance sheets and rebuild buffers, but growth appears to have peaked in some major economies, as discussed in the october 2018 world economic outlook (weo). yet financial conditions in advanced economies remain accommodative, particularly in the united states, with interest rates still low by historical standards, risk appetite robust, and asset valuations rising in major markets. financial conditions have remained broadly stable in china, where authorities have eased monetary policy to offset external pressures and the impact of tighter financial regulations. in contrast, financial conditions in most emerging market economies have tightened since mid-april, driven by higher external financing costs, rising idiosyncratic risks, and escalating trade tensions. as noted in the april gfsr, notwithstanding improved fundamentals over recent years, emerging market economies remain vulnerable to spillovers from monetary policy normalization in advanced economies and could face reduced capital inflows even under a relatively benign baseline scenario. since then, with rising u.s. interest rates and a stronger dollar, as well as the intensification of trade tensions, a number of emerging market economies have experienced a reversal in portfolio flows. but with buoyant global risk appetite, market pressures have to date been concentrated in countries with large external imbalances and weak policy frameworks. however, the imf’s capital-flows-at-risk analysis suggests that with a 5 percent probability, emerging market economies (excluding china) could face debt portfolio outflows in the medium term of $100 billion or more over a period of four quarters (or 0.6 percent of their combined gdp), broadly similar in magnitude to the global financial crisis. near-term risks to global financial stability— assessed using the growth-at-risk (gar) approach— have increased somewhat over the past six months. however, a much sharper tightening of financial conditions in advanced economies would significantly increase short-term risks. an intensification of concerns about the resilience and policy credibility in emerging markets may lead to further capital outflows and possibly rising global risk aversion. a broader escalation of trade actions may undermine investor confidence, harming the economic expansion. political and policy uncertainty (for example, in the event of a no-deal brexit or the reemergence of concerns about fiscal policy in some highly indebted euro area countries) could adversely affect market sentiment and lead to a spike in risk aversion. finally, with inflation firming up, central banks may step up the pace of monetary policy normalization, which could lead to a sudden tightening of global financial conditions. overall, market participants appear complacent about the risk of a sharp tightening of financial conditions. medium-term risks to global financial stability and growth remain elevated. a number of vulnerabilities that have built up over the years could be exposed by a sudden, sharp tightening of financial conditions. in advanced economies, key financial vulnerabilities include high and rising leverage levels in the nonfinancial sector, continued deterioration in underwriting standards, and stretched asset valuations in some major markets. total nonfinancial sector debt in jurisdictions with systemically important financial sectors has grown from $113 trillion (more than 200 percent of their combined gdp) in 2008 to $167 trillion (close to 250 executive summary',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2015 ixfinancial stability has improved in advanced economies financial stability has improved in advanced economies since the april 2015 global financial stability report. this progress reflects a strengthening macrofinancial environment in advanced economies as the recovery has broadened, confidence in monetary policies has firmed, and deflation risks have abated somewhat in the euro area. the federal reserve is poised to raise interest rates as the preconditions for liftoff are nearly in place. this increase should help slow the further buildup of excesses in financial risk taking. partly due to confidence in the european central bank’s (ecb’s) policies, credit conditions are improving and credit demand is pick-ing up. corporate sectors are showing tentative signs of improvement that could spawn increased investment and economic risk taking, including in the united states and japan, albeit from low levels. risks continue to rotate toward emerging markets, amid greater market liquidity risks despite these improvements in advanced economies, emerging market vulnerabilities remain elevated, risk appetite has fallen, and market liquidity risks are higher. although many emerging market economies have enhanced their policy frameworks and resilience to external shocks, several key economies face substantial domestic imbalances and lower growth, as noted in the october 2015 world economic outlook (weo). many emerging market economies relied on rapid credit creation to sidestep the worst impacts of the global crisis. this increased borrowing has resulted in sharply higher leverage of the private sector in many economies, par-ticularly in cyclical sectors, accompanied by rising foreign currency exposures increasingly driven by global factors. this confluence of borrowing and foreign currency expo-sure has increased the sensitivity of these economies to a tightening of global financial conditions (see chapter 3). as emerging market economies approach the late stage of the credit cycle, banks have thinner capital cushions, while nonperforming loans are set to rise as corporate earnings and asset quality deteriorate. in china, banks have only recently begun to address the growing asset quality challenges associated with rising weaknesses in key areas of the corporate sector. these developments in emerging market banking systems stand in contrast to those in advanced economies, where banks have spent the past few years deleverag-ing and repairing balance sheets, raising capital, and strengthening funding arrangements. against a challenging backdrop of falling commodity prices and weaker growth, several emerging market sovereigns are at greater risk of losing investment-grade ratings in the medium term. pressures on sovereign ratings could intensify if contingent liabilities of state-owned enterprises—with a large and rising share of emerging market corporate bond issuance—have to be assumed by the sovereign, for example, from firms in the oil, gas, and utility sectors. policymakers confront a triad of challenges the baseline outlook for financial stability, consistent with the october 2015 weo, is characterized by continuing cyclical recovery, but with weak prospects for medium-term growth in both advanced econo-mies and emerging markets. in advanced economies, improvements in private balance sheets and continued accommodative monetary and financial conditions have spurred a cyclical recovery, but the handover to higher levels of self-sustaining growth is incomplete. emerging markets face substantial challenges in adjust-ing to the new global market realities from a position of higher vulnerability. successful normalization of financial and monetary conditions would bring macrofinancial benefits and considerably reduce downside risks. this report ana-lyzes the prospects for normalization according to three scenarios: the baseline, an upside scenario of successful normalization, and a downside scenario characterized by disruptions in global asset markets. against this backdrop, the global financial outlook is clouded by a triad of broad policy challenges in evidence over the past several months: executive summary',\n",
              " 'x international monetary fund | october 2015 global financial stability report: vulnerabilities, legacies, and policy challenges: risks rotating to emerging markets• emerging market vulnerabilities—as examined in the weo, growth in emerging markets and developing economies is projected to decline for the fifth year in a row. many emerging markets have increased their resilience to external shocks with increased exchange rate flexibility, higher foreign exchange reserves, increased reliance on fdi flows and domestic-currency external financing, and generally stronger policy frameworks. but balance sheets have become stretched thinner in many emerging market com-panies and banks. these firms have become more susceptible to financial stress, economic downturn, and capital outflows. deteriorating corporate health runs the risk of deepening the sovereign-corporate and the corporate-bank nexus in some key emerging markets. china in particular faces a delicate bal-ance of transitioning to more consumption-driven growth without activity slowing too much, while reducing financial vulnerabilities and moving toward a more market-based system—a challenging set of objectives. recent market developments, including slumping commodity prices, china’s bursting equity and margin-lending bubble, falling emerging market equities, and pressure on exchange rates, underscore these challenges. legacy issues from the crisis in advanced economies—high public and private debt in advanced economies and remaining gaps in the euro area architecture need to be addressed to consolidate financial stabil-ity, and avoid political tensions and headwinds to confidence and growth. in the euro area, addressing remaining sovereign and banking vulnerabilities is still a challenge. weak systemic market liquidity—this poses a challenge in adjusting to new equilibria in markets and the wider economy. extraordinarily accommodative policies have contributed to a compression of risk pre-miums across a range of markets including sovereign bonds and corporate credit, as well as a compression of liquidity and equity risk premiums. while recent market developments have unwound some of this compression, risk premiums could still rise further. now that the federal reserve looks set to begin the gradual process of tightening monetary policy, the global financial system faces an unprecedented adjust-ment as risk premiums “normalize” from historically low levels alongside rising policy rates and a modest cyclical recovery. abnormal market conditions will need to adjust smoothly to the new environment. but there are risks from a rapid decompression, particu-larly given what appears to be more brittle market structures and market fragilities concentrated in credit intermediation channels, which could come to the fore as financial conditions normalize (see chapter 2). indeed, recent episodes of high market volatility and liquidity dislocations across advanced and emerging market asset classes highlight this challenge. strong policy actions are needed to ensure “successful normalization” the relatively weak baseline for both financial stability and the economic outlook leaves risks tilted to the downside. thus, ensuring successful normalization of financial and monetary conditions and a smooth handover to higher growth requires further policy efforts to tackle pressing challenges. these should include the following: • continued effort by the federal reserve to provide clear and consistent communication, enabling the smooth absorption of rising u.s. rates, which is essential for global financial health. in the euro area, more progress in strengthening the financial architecture of the common currency to bolster market and business confidence. addressing the overhang of private debt and bank nonperform-ing loans in the euro area would support bank finance and corporate health, and boost investment. rebalancing and gradual deleveraging in china, which will require great care and strong commit-ments to market-based reforms and further strength-ening of the financial system. more broadly, addressing both cyclical and structural challenges in emerging markets, which will be criti-cal to underpin improved prospects and resilience. authorities in emerging markets should regularly monitor corporate foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions, and use micro- and macroprudential tools to discourage the buildup of excessive leverage and foreign indebtedness. safeguarding against market illiquidity and strength-ening market structures, which are priorities, espe-cially in advanced economies’ markets. ensuring the soundness and health of banks and the long-term savings complex (for example, insurers and pension funds), which is critical, as highlighted in the april 2015 gfsr.

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2015 xiwith bold and upgraded financial policy actions detailed in the report, policymakers can help deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability, while avoiding downside risks. such an upside scenario would benefit the world economy and raise global output 0.4 percent above the baseline by 2018. further growth-enhancing structural reforms, detailed in the weo, could bring additional support to growth and stability, beyond the benefits detailed here. possible shocks or policy missteps could lead to a global asset market disruption without the implementation of policies to ensure successful normalization, potential adverse shocks or policy missteps could trigger an abrupt rise in market risk premiums and a rapid erosion of policy confidence. shocks may originate in advanced or emerging markets and, combined with unaddressed system vulnerabilities, could lead to a global asset market disruption and a sud-den drying up of market liquidity in many asset classes. under these conditions, a significant—even if tempo-rary—mispricing of assets may ensue, with negative repercussions on financial stability (see chapter 2). in such an adverse scenario, substantially tighter financial conditions could stall the cyclical recovery and weaken confidence in medium-term growth prospects. low nominal growth would put pressure on debt-laden sovereign and private balance sheets, raising credit risks. emerging markets would face higher global risk premiums and substantial capital outflows, putting particular pressure on economies with domestic imbalances. corporate default rates would rise, particularly in china, raising financial system strains, with implications for growth. these events would lead to a reappearance of risks on sover-eign balance sheets, especially in europe’s vulnerable economies, and the emergence of an adverse feedback loop between corporate and sovereign risks in emerg-ing markets. as a result, aggregate global output could be as much as 2.4 percent lower by 2017, relative to the baseline. this implies lower but still positive global growth.',\n",
              " ' international monetary fund | april 2015 ixmacroeconomic shocks pose new challenges for global markets a wide range of positive and negative macroeconomic and financial developments have occurred in the past six months. on a net basis, these developments have increased financial stability risks. on the positive side, as discussed in the april 2015 world economic outlook, growth in 2015 is expected to be slightly higher than that of 2014, improving in advanced economies enough to offset slower growth in emerging market and developing economies. sharply lower oil and commodity prices, coupled with lower interest rates from expanded monetary accommodation, are expected to support growth through 2016. bold monetary policy actions have been taken in both the euro area and japan to arrest and reverse disinflation-ary pressures. quantitative easing provides a strong framework for addressing deflation risks, and some key transmission channels are already working. spreads on credit have narrowed in the euro area, equity prices have surged, and the euro and yen have depreciated significantly, helping to raise inflation expectations. at the same time, the u.s. dollar has appreciated substantially, reflecting diverging monetary policies. the dollar has strengthened more against major currencies during the past nine months than it has during any similar period since 1981. the resulting movements in real exchange rates have broadly reflected changes in growth prospects and exposures to lower oil prices, and should help support the global recovery. however, the financial stability risks around this baseline are rising and rotating. although the benefits of the improving baseline are widely distributed and accrue over time, the adverse impact of recent shocks is concen-trated and is already affecting sectors and economies with preexisting vulnerabilities. meanwhile, continued financial risk taking and structural changes in credit markets are shifting the locus of financial stability risks from advanced economies to emerging markets, from banks to shadow banks, and from solvency to market liquidity risks.• continued financial risk taking and search for yield keep stretching some asset valuations. the low inter-est rate environment also poses challenges for long-term investors, particularly for weaker life insurance companies in europe. oil- and commodity-exporting countries and firms have been severely affected by falling asset valuations and rising credit risks. energy and commodity firms in emerging markets, which account for more than a third of nonfinancial corporate bonds issued in hard currency since 2007, have been particularly hard hit. strains in the debt-repayment capacity of the oil and gas sector have become more evident for firms in argentina, brazil, nigeria, and south africa because of low oil prices, as well as for sovereigns reliant on oil revenues such as nigeria and venezuela. rapidly depreciating exchange rates have increased pressures on firms that borrowed heavily in for-eign currencies and have sparked significant capital outflows for several emerging markets. these developments could add stress to emerging mar-ket sovereigns that have increased their combined exposure to foreign currency borrowings and foreign investor holdings of local currency debt. volatility in major exchange rates has increased by more than during any similar period since the global financial crisis. reduced liquidity in both the foreign exchange and fixed-income markets, as well as the changing composition of the investor bases in these markets, has added frictions to portfolio adjustments. the resulting tensions in global finan-cial markets have increased market and liquidity risks, given that sudden episodes of volatility could become more common and more pronounced. existing legacy challenges add to these pressures, leav-ing overall financial stability risks higher. financial stability is not fully grounded in advanced economies, and risks have increased in many emerging markets long-term bond yields in many advanced economies have decreased on disinflation concerns and the prospect of continued monetary accommodation. in the euro executive summary',\n",

sovereign bonds now carry negative yields. but a prolonged low interest rate environment will pose severe challenges for a number of financial institutions. weak european mid-sized life insurers face a high and rising risk of distress—stress tests (conducted by the european insurance and occupational pensions authority) show that 24 percent of insurers may not be able to meet their solvency capital requirements under a prolonged low interest rate scenario. the industry has a portfolio of €4.4 trillion in assets in the european union, with high and rising interconnectedness with the wider financial system, creating a potential source of spillovers. high debt levels in the private sector continue to hinder growth and financial stability. accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies have helped reduce private sector debt ratios by supporting inflation and growth and by increasing asset prices. however, the assumptions for growth and inflation in this report sug-gest that private sector debt levels in a number of major advanced economies will remain high. this continuing high debt calls for an additional response to address the crisis legacies and unshackle economic potential. gross corporate debt in france, italy, portugal, and spain is expected to remain above or near 70 percent of gdp by 2020, and gross household debt in portugal and the united kingdom is projected to remain high compared with that of other major advanced economies. at the same time there is a clear upside risk to interest rates in the united states. t wo possible scenarios charac-terize the future normalization of u.s. monetary policy: a smooth well-telegraphed exit, or, despite clear com-munication, a bumpy ride with a more rapid decompres-sion of term premiums leading to rapidly rising yields and substantially higher volatility. indeed, declines in structural liquidity in fixed-income markets in both the united states and other economies have amplified asset price responses to shocks, increasing potential spillovers. technological change, increased regulation, and the shifting composition of market participants have altered the microstructure of fixed-income markets. illiquidity events now spill over to other asset classes and to emerg-ing markets, as witnessed in the u.s. t reasury market and in policy-induced instability in foreign exchange markets following the removal of the swiss franc floor. these developments highlight some key vulnerabilities in capital markets and the shadow banking system. emerging markets are caught in these global crosscurrents, as they address their own domestic challenges. lower commodity prices and lower inflationary pressures are benefiting many emerging market economies, provid-ing monetary policy space to combat slowing growth. however, oil- and commodity-exporting countries and countries with high foreign indebtedness face more formidable risks. although the stronger dollar can help improve competitiveness in emerging market economies in general, and lead to higher growth, the dramatic movements in commodity prices and in the exchange rates of many emerging market economies during the past six months have already had a significant impact on firms’ market valuations in these economies. many companies borrowed heavily in international markets—substituting international borrowings in dollars for local currency borrowing from banks—potentially leading to balance sheet pressures. in turn, a retrenchment of overinvested industries, real estate sector adjustments, and property price declines—especially in china—could spill over to emerging markets more broadly. the broader impact of a sudden deterioration in corporate health on banking system stability depends on credit exposures. in china, exposures to real estate (excluding mortgages) are almost 20 percent of gdp , and financial stress among real estate firms could lead to direct cross-border spill-overs, given the substantial increase in external bond issuance since 2010. in 11 of the 21 emerging market banking systems analyzed in this report, more than half of the bank loan books consists of loans to firms, rendering them more exposed to corporate weakness, particularly in nigeria, peru, t urkey, and ukraine. in a downside risk scenario, further rapid dollar appreciation and an abrupt rise in u.s. interest rates, coupled with a rise in geopolitical risks, could put added pressure on emerging market currencies and asset markets. after a prolonged period of inflows, for-eign investors could abruptly reduce their holdings of local currency debt, thereby adding to turbulence and creating debt rollover challenges. markets also appear complacent when it comes to geopolitical and politi-cal risks. as noted in the april 2015 world economic outlook, ongoing events in russia and ukraine, the middle east, and parts of africa could lead to greater tensions and increased disruptions to global trade and financial transactions. direct financial linkages between russia and the rest of the world are limited, but the indirect connections with neighboring countries could raise financial stability risks. stronger institutional frameworks in the euro area have reduced the threat ',\n",

increasing liquidity cash buffers in mutual funds; and improving the liquidity and transparency of secondary markets, especially of longer-term debt markets. market participants in government bond and foreign exchange markets should also have greater incentives to provide secondary market liquid-ity. authorities should review current circuit breakers to enhance their functioning. risk management and control should be reinforced: supervisors should provide coor-dinated guidance to trading firms, allowing them to set consistent and appropriate risk limits on individual retail investors. regulators and monetary authorities should consider the correlation between asset classes when evalu-ating systemic risks in financial markets. emerging markets\\xa0should aim to cushion the impact of global headwinds and safeguard the resilience of their financial systems through enhanced surveillance of vulnerable sectors, particularly in the following areas:• in china, the overall priority must be to allow an orderly correction of excesses, curtailing the riskiest parts of shadow banking. at the same time, orderly deleveraging requires comprehensive policies that allow credit growth to slow gradually and, where necessary, the mechanisms to be provided for orderly corporate debt restructuring, and the exit of nonvi-able firms. across emerging markets more generally, the large portion of debt denominated in foreign currencies means that micro- and macroprudential measures have important roles to play in limiting the risks from shocks. regulators need to conduct bank stress tests related to foreign currency and commodity price risks and more closely and regularly monitor corporate leverage and foreign currency exposures, including derivatives positions. to ensure markets function properly, authorities need to prepare for lapses of liquidity in local cur-rency bond markets. country authorities might potentially use cash balances when needed, or lower the supply of long-term debt to the market to help curtail bond spread increases. bilateral and multilateral swap line agreements, by providing foreign currency funding in times of stress, can enhance confidence and help reduce excess volatil-ity in currency markets. multilateral resources such as imf facilities could also provide additional buffers.the international financial regulatory reform agenda has strengthened regulatory frameworks, and is helping to make financial institutions and the global financial system more robust. global standard setters and national regulators now need to provide further clarity about regulatory standards—and thus improve certainty for banks adapting their business models—by finalizing the calibration of recent requirements, including the leverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio, and total loss-absorbing capital requirements. promptly putting in place regulations to transform shadow banking into a stable source of market-based finance is also a must. at the same time, micro- and macroprudential policies for nonbanks should be strengthened. exist-ing regulatory frameworks may need to be reassessed to enable the authorities to better understand the less closely regulated corners of the financial sector that could cause problems for the banking system and the broader economy, and act as needed to mitigate identi-fied vulnerabilities. changes in international banking models have reduced risks in host financial systems on a more positive note, chapter 2, which examines changes in international banking since the global finan-cial crisis, finds that these changes are likely to promote more stable bank lending in host countries. it also finds a need for more international cooperation for dealing with regional or global shocks to maximize the benefits of cross-border banking while mitigating risks. international banks, especially those in europe, have reduced their cross-border lending, while local loans by branches and subsidiaries of foreign banks abroad have remained steady. local and regional banks have stepped in to offset, at least partially, euro area banks’ reduction in exposure to some regions. as a result, intraregional linkages have deepened, in particular in asia. regulatory changes and weaknesses in bank balance sheets have contributed significantly in the past to the observed cutback in cross-border lending, whereas accommodative monetary policies may have slowed the cutback. the relative shift from cross-border lending to more local lending by affiliates should improve the finan-cial stability of host countries. cross-border lending flows are more sensitive to global shocks than are local lending and international portfolio flows. cross-border lending also tends to amplify the effect of adverse ',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | april 2016 ixrisks to global financial stability have increased since the october 2015 global financial stability report. in advanced economies, the outlook has deteriorated because of heightened uncertainty and set-backs to growth and confidence. disruptions to global asset markets have added to these pressures. declines in oil and commodity prices have kept risks elevated in emerging market economies, while greater uncertainty about china’s growth transition has increased spill-overs to global markets. these developments tightened financial conditions, reduced risk appetite, raised credit risks, and stymied balance sheet repair, undermining financial stability. many market prices dropped dramatically during the turmoil in january and february, moving asset valuations to levels below those consistent with macroeconomic fundamentals that suggest a steady but slowly improving growth path (see the april 2016 world economic outlook). instead, heightened market volatility and risk aversion may have reflected ris-ing economic, financial, and political risks as well as weakened confidence in policies. the recovery in asset prices since february has reversed much of these losses and lowered volatility. market sentiment has been sup-ported by higher oil and commodity prices, stronger data out of the united states, and supportive actions by central banks. but the net impact of the turmoil has been a shock to confidence, with negative repercus-sions for financial stability. the main message of this report is that additional measures are needed to deliver a more balanced and potent policy mix for improving the growth and infla-tion outlook and securing financial stability. in the absence of such measures, market turmoil may recur. in such circumstances, rising risk premiums may tighten financial conditions further, creating a pernicious feed-back loop of fragile confidence, weaker growth, lower inflation, and rising debt burdens. disruptions to global asset markets could increase the risks of tipping into a more serious and prolonged slowdown marked by finan-cial and economic stagnation. in a situation of financial stagnation, financial institutions responsible for the allocation of capital and mobilization of savings might struggle with impaired balance sheets for an extended period of time. financial soundness could become eroded to such an extent that both economic growth and financial stability are adversely affected in the medium term. in such a scenario, world output could fall by 3.9 percent relative to the baseline by 2021. policymakers need to build on the current economic recovery and deliver a stronger path for growth and financial stability by tackling a triad of global chal-lenges—legacy challenges in advanced economies, elevated vulnerabilities in emerging markets, and greater systemic market liquidity risks. progress along this path will enable the world’s economies to make a decisive break toward a strong and healthy financial system and a sustained recovery. in such a scenario, world output could expand by 1.7 percent relative to the baseline by 2018. advanced economies must deal with crisis legacy issues. banks in advanced economies have become safer in recent years, with stronger capital and liquid-ity buffers and progress in repairing balance sheets. despite these gains, banks came under market pres-sure at the start of the year, reflecting concerns about the profitability of banks’ business models in a weak economic environment. approximately 15 percent of banks in advanced economies (by assets) face signifi-cant challenges in attaining sustainable profitability without reform. in the euro area, market pressures also highlighted long-standing legacy issues, indicat-ing that a more complete solution to european banks’ problems cannot be further postponed. elevated nonperforming loans urgently need to be tackled using a comprehensive strategy, and excess capac-ity in the euro area banking system will have to be addressed over time. in the united states, mortgage markets—which were at the epicenter of the 2008–09 crisis—continue to benefit from significant govern-ment support. authorities should reinvigorate efforts to reduce the dominance of fannie mae and freddie mac and continue with reforms of these institutions. chapter 3 shows that across advanced economies, the contribution of the insurance sector—particularly life insurers—to systemic risk has increased, although not executive summary',\n",

largely a result of growing common exposures to aggre-gate risk, partly because insurers’ interest rate sensitivity has risen and partly because of higher correlations across asset classes. in the event of an adverse shock, therefore, insurers are unlikely to fulfill their role as financial inter-mediaries at a time when other parts of the financial system are also struggling to do so. these findings suggest that a more macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation of insurance companies should be taken. measures could include regular macroprudential stress testing or the adoption of countercyclical capital buffers. steps that would complement a push for stronger macroprudential poli-cies include the international adoption of capital and transparency standards for the sector. in addition, the different behavior of smaller and weaker insurers war-rants attention by supervisors. emerging markets need to bolster their resilience to global headwinds. emerging market economies are faced with a difficult combination of slower growth, weaker commodity prices, and tighter credit condi-tions, amid more volatile portfolio flows. this mixture has kept financial and economic risks elevated. so far, many economies have shown remarkable resilience to this more difficult domestic and external environment, as policymakers have made judicious use of buffers in strengthened policy frameworks. commodity-related firms are cutting capital expenditures sharply as high private debt burdens reinforce risks to credit and banks. commodity-exporting countries and those in the middle east and the caucasus are particularly exposed to strains across the real economy and the financial sector. the nexus between state-owned enterprises (soes) and sovereigns has intensified, and could increase fiscal and financial stability risks in countries with repayment pressures. more broadly, debt belonging to nonfinancial corpora-tions with reduced ability to repay have risen to $650 billion, or 12 percent of total corporate debt of listed firms considered in this report. bank capital buffers are generally adequate, but will likely be tested by weaker earnings and the downturn in the credit cycle. emerging market economies generally have the tools to boost their resilience and counter the effects of lower commodity prices and the slowdown in growth and capital flows. authorities in emerg-ing market economies should continue to use their buffers and policy space, where available, to smooth adjustment and strengthen sovereign and bank bal-ance sheets. this includes using external buffers, fiscal and monetary policy, and macroprudential and supervisory frameworks, among other tools. coun-tries with insufficient buffers and limited policy space should act early by adjusting macroeconomic policies to address their vulnerabilities, including by seeking external support. china’s economic rebalancing is gaining traction. the country has made notable progress in rebalanc-ing its economy toward new sources of growth and addressing some financial sector risks. in addition, stricter regulation of shadow banking activities has helped steer the composition of financing toward bank loans and bond issuance. nevertheless, china’s rebalancing is inherently complex, and commitment to a more ambitious and comprehensive policy agenda is urgently needed to stay ahead of rising vulnerabilities. slowing growth has eroded corporate sector health, with falling profitability undermining the debt-servicing capacity of firms holding some 14 percent of the debt of listed companies, adding to balance sheet stresses across the system.\\xa0a comprehensive plan to address the corporate debt overhang would assist a steady deleveraging process. corporate deleveraging should be accompanied by a strengthening of banks and social safety nets, especially for displaced workers in overcapacity sectors. a comprehensive restructuring program to deal with bad assets and strengthen banks should be developed swiftly, along with a sound legal and institutional framework for facilitating bankruptcy and debt-workout processes. chapter 2 finds that spillovers of emerging market shocks to equity prices and exchange rates have risen substantially, and now explain more than a third of the variation in asset returns. this underscores the impor-tance for policymakers in both advanced economies and emerging markets of taking account of economic and policy developments in emerging market econo-mies when assessing domestic macro-financial condi-tions. financial integration, more than economic size and trade integration, is key to an emerging market economy’s role as receiver and emitter of financial spill-overs. the level of

              " ' in ternational monetary fund | april 2014 ixthe global financial system is undergoing a number of challenging transitions on the path to greater stability. as the economic recovery in the united states gains footing, u.s. monetary policy has begun to normalize. emerging market economies are transitioning to more sustainable growth in the financial sector, while addressing macroeconomic vulnerabilities amid a less favorable external financial environment. the euro area is strengthening bank capital positions as it moves from fragmentation to a more robust framework for integration. these transitions are far from complete, and stability conditions are far from normal. since october, bouts of financial turbulence have highlighted the substantial adjustment that lies ahead. in advanced economies, financial markets continue to be supported by extraor-dinary monetary accommodation and easy liquidity conditions. they will need to transition away from these supports if they are to create an environment of self-sustaining growth, marked by increased corporate investment and growing employment. for advanced and emerging market economies alike, a successful shift from “liquidity-driven” to “growth-driven” markets requires a number of elements, including a normalization of u.s. monetary policy that avoids financial stability risks; financial rebalancing in emerging market economies amid tighter external financial conditions; further progress in the euro area’s transition from fragmentation to robust integration; and the successful implementation of “abenomics” to deliver sustained growth and stable inflation in japan. the gradual shift to self-sustaining growth is most advanced in the united states, where green shoots are evident from the economic recovery under way, as noted in the april 2014 world economic outlook. the u.s. transition presents several challenges to financial stability. the “search for yield” is becoming increas-ingly extended, with rising leverage in the corporate sector and weakening underwriting standards in some pockets of u.s. credit markets. weaker market liquid-ity and the rapid growth of investment vehicles that are vulnerable to redemption risk could amplify finan-cial or economic shocks. in this transitional period, the reduction in u.s. monetary accommodation could have important spillovers to advanced and emerging market economies alike as portfolios adjust and risks are repriced. amid this shifting global environment, emerging market economies face their own transition challenges, but with substantial differences across economies. private and public balance sheets have become more leveraged since the beginning of the crisis and thus are more sensitive to changes in domestic and external conditions. macroeconomic imbalances have increased in a number of economies in the past few years, while the increased participation of foreign investors in domestic bond markets exposes some economies to an additional source of market volatility and pressure on capital flows. these developments have created a “systemic liquidity mismatch,” that is, a disjunction between the potential scale of capital outflows and the capacity of local institutions and market makers (in particular, international banks) to intermediate them. this bottle-neck could magnify the impact of any shocks emanat-ing from other economies and broaden the impact on asset prices, particularly if asset managers seek to hedge exposures by taking positions in more liquid but unrelated markets. the mismatch could create circum-stances where authorities may have to provide liquidity executive summary transition from liquidity- to growth-driven markets normalizing monetary po licy: a “goldilocks” exit?united states as the tide of liquidity ebbs: more ﬁnancial balancing neededemerging markets from deﬂ ation to reﬂ ation: so far so g ood, but much work lies aheadjapanfrom fragmenta tion to robust integration: progress, but picture sti ll mixedeuro area',\n",

if too slow, it will allow vulnerabilities to continue build-ing. other keys to the success of an orderly transition include upgrading the central bank’s ability to address unpredictable shifts in liquidity demand, timely imple-mentation of deposit insurance and interest rate liber-alization, and strengthening the resolution framework for failed financial institutions. in the euro area, policies implemented at both the national and european levels are supporting the transition to a more robust framework for integration, but important challenges remain. the restructuring of the debt-burdened euro area corporate sector has been stalled by the unfinished repair of bank balance sheets. moreover, credit conditions remain difficult in stressed euro area economies. although market sentiment regarding stressed euro area banks and sovereigns has improved markedly, it may be running ahead of the necessary balance-sheet repair. thus, european policy-makers must push ahead with a rigorous and transpar-ent assessment of the current health of the banking system, followed by a determined cleansing of balance sheets and the removal of banks that are no longer viable. additional measures to improve nonbank credit and equity channels are also required. the resulting tangible strengthening of balance sheets will help rein-force the improved optimism in financial markets. in japan, continued monetary accommodation is necessary but not sufficient for renewed economic dynamism to take root. the transition to higher sustained growth and lower debt-related risks requires the enactment of persuasive structural reforms. the first stages of abenomics have been largely successful in altering deflationary expectations, but consolidating these gains in financial stability and expanding them will require continued efforts. more broadly, maintaining the momentum and impetus for reform and good policies may prove chal-lenging, amid a crowded electoral calendar in many countries. geopolitical risks related to ukraine could also pose a more serious threat to financial stability if they were to escalate. greater spillovers to activity beyond neighboring trading partners could emerge if further turmoil leads to a renewed bout of increased risk aversion in global financial markets, or from disruptions to trade and finance. against this back-drop, there is a need for strengthened and cooperative policy actions to help reduce risks of renewed turmoil in the global economy, both by reducing external imbalances and their associated internal distortions and by improving market confidence. furthermore, an enhanced dialog between supervisors in advanced and emerging market economies should help ensure that cross-border liquidity and credit are not disrupted. chapter 2 discusses the evolving landscape of portfolio investment in emerging market economies over the past 15 years. their financial markets have deepened and become more globalized. greater direct participation by global investors has stimulated the development of new asset class segments, including local currency sovereign debt markets. the mix of global investors has also changed, and bond funds have become more prominent—especially local currency funds, open-end funds with easy redemption options, and funds investing only opportunistically in emerg-ing market economies. chapter 2 draws on a variety of methods and relatively unexploited data to examine the implications of these changes for the stability of portfolio flows and asset prices in emerging market economies. it finds that changes in the composition of global portfolio investors are likely to make overall portfolio flows more sensitive to global financial shocks. the share of more volatile bond flows has risen, and larger ',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2014 ixsix years after the start of the crisis, the global economic recovery continues to rely heavily on accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies to support demand, encourage corporate investment, and facilitate balance sheet repair. monetary accommodation remains critical in supporting the economy by encouraging economic risk taking in advanced economies, in the form of increased real spending by households and greater willingness to invest and hire by businesses. however, prolonged monetary ease may also encourage excessive financial risk taking, in the form of increased portfolio allocations to riskier assets and increased willingness to lever-age balance sheets. thus, accommodative monetary policies face a trade-off between the upside economic benefits and the downside financial stability risks. this report finds that although the economic benefits are becoming more evident in some economies, market and liquidity risks have increased to levels that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed. the best way to safeguard financial stability and improve the balance between economic and financial risk taking is to put in place policies that enhance the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy—thus promoting economic risk taking—and address financial excesses through well-designed macropruden-tial measures. economic risk taking is advancing but uneven the october 2014 world economic outlook (weo) projects the global recovery to strengthen modestly this year and continue into 2015, supported by accom-modative monetary policies in advanced economies and declining headwinds from tighter fiscal policy. however, growth is not yet robust across the globe, and downside risks have risen. business and consumer confidence remains fragile in many areas, reflecting uncertainties about the recovery of private demand and concerns about incomplete balance sheet repair in banks and corporations. this shortfall in confidence continues to impede greater economic risk taking, making corporations in advanced economies reluctant to ramp up capital investment, despite reasonable earnings growth and access to funding at very low interest rates. balance sheet repair and monetary policy are now combining to support greater economic risk taking and a brighter outlook for capital expendi-ture. but prospects are uneven, reflecting a variety of impediments. on the brighter side is the united states, where business fixed investment has been picking up, although at a slower pace than in previous recover-ies. capacity utilization is returning to precrisis levels and banks are loosening lending standards, as companies are increasingly focusing on invest-ment rather than equity buybacks. in the euro area, however, growth in business fixed investment remains weak. capacity utilization is still below precrisis levels, banks have only recently stopped tightening corporate lending, and economic policy uncertainty remains elevated. a number of major emerging mar-ket economies are facing weakening export growth and slowing credit expansion. in those countries, capital expenditures in major nonfinancial firms declined across the board in 2013. the weo expects the strongest rebound in overall growth in the united states, whereas the brakes on recovery in the euro area will ease only slowly, and growth in japan will remain modest. for emerging markets, the scope for macroeconomic policies to sup-port growth varies across countries and regions, but space remains limited in several countries with external vulnerabilities. easy money continues to increase global financial stability risks accommodative policies aimed at supporting the recovery and promoting economic risk taking have facilitated greater financial risk taking. this has resulted in asset price appreciation, spread compres-sion, and record low volatility, in many areas reaching levels that indicate divergence from fundamentals. what is unusual about these developments is their syn-chronicity: they have occurred simultaneously across broad asset classes and across countries in a way that is unprecedented. executive summary',\n",
              " 'x international monetary fund | october 2014 global financial stability report: risk taking, liquidity , and shadow banking—curbing excess while promoting growthcapital markets have become more significant providers of credit since the crisis, shifting the locus of risks to the shadow banking system. the share of credit instruments held in mutual fund portfolios has been growing, doubling since 2007, and now amounts to 27 percent of global high-yield debt. at the same time, the fund management industry has become more con-centrated. the top 10 global asset management firms now account for more than $19 trillion in assets under management. the combination of asset concentration, extended portfolio positions and valuations, flight-prone investors, and vulnerable liquidity structures have increased the sensitivity of key credit markets, increasing market and liquidity risks. emerging markets are more vulnerable to shocks from advanced economies, as they now absorb a much larger share of the outward portfolio investment from advanced economies. a consequence of these stronger links is the increased synchronization of asset price movements and volatilities. these structural changes in credit markets, together with the expected normalization of monetary policy in the united states, have raised market and liquidity risks in ways that could compromise financial stability if left unaddressed. the increased sensitivity of credit markets could make the exit process more volatile, potentially undermining the ability of the financial system to support the recovery. to illustrate these potential risks to credit markets, this report examines the impact of a rapid market adjustment that causes term premiums in bond markets to revert to historic norms (increasing by 100 basis points) and credit risk premiums to normalize (a repricing of credit risks by 100 basis points). such a shock could reduce the market value of global bond portfolios by more than 8 percent, or in excess of $3.8 trillion. if losses on this scale were to materialize over a short time horizon, the ensuing portfolio adjustments and market turmoil could trigger significant disruption in global markets. managing risks from an ongoing overhaul in bank business models to better support economic risk taking the policy challenge is to remove impediments to economic risk taking and strengthen the transmission of credit to the real economy. banks have come a long way since the global financial crisis. adjustment has proceeded at different stages, with the first stage focus-ing on emergency stabilization measures. in the second phase, banks have strived to adapt to new business and regulatory realities. since the start of the crisis, banks hold significantly more capital and have accelerated balance sheet repair. but progress has been uneven across banks and many institutions need to do more to achieve a sustainable business model. today, low profitability raises concerns about some banks’ ability to build and maintain capital buffers and meet credit demand. reflecting the size and breadth of the challenge, 80 percent of assets of the largest institu-tions have a return on equity that does not cover the cost of capital required by shareholders. these banks are entering a third phase, in which they will need a more fundamental overhaul of their business models. this will include a combination of repricing existing business lines, reallocating capital across activities, restructuring, or retrenching altogether. based on a sample of 300 advanced economy banks, this report finds that many banks have the potential capacity to supply credit, although there is a group of institutions, mostly from the euro area, that would require a high level of repricing to generate sustainable profits and rebuild capital buffers. such a repricing may not be feasible, especially if done on a stand-alone basis and not followed by other market participants. this could limit these banks’ capacity to meet credit demand, particularly in those countries that are in greatest need of a recovery in credit, and create head-winds for the economic recovery. strengthening the transmission of credit means, in part, encouraging the prompt and orderly exit of nonviable banks. this would help relieve competi-tive pressures in a context of excess capacity and allow viable banks to build and maintain capital buffers and meet credit demand. regulators can further assist that process by encouraging banks to move away from old practices of cross-subsidizing products and adopt more flexible and transparent business models with product pricing that reflects risks and regulatory requirements. the credit transmission mechanism will also be aided, particularly in europe, by greater market-based access to credit, including through safe securitization. this will take time, particularly for financial systems that have traditionally been reliant on bank lending. removing impediments to nonbank participation in credit origination will require solid regulatory frame-works for nonbanks. as discussed further in chapter 2, policymakers

              " ' international monetary fund | april 2013 xiexecutive summary chapter 1: acute risks reduced: actions needed to entrench financial s tability global financial and market conditions have improved appreciably in the past six months, providing additional support to the economy and prompting a sharp rally in risk assets. these favor-able conditions reflect a combination of deeper policy commitments, renewed monetary stimulus, and continued liquidity support. together, these actions have reduced tail risks, enhanced confidence, and bolstered the economic outlook. however, as global economic conditions remain subdued, the improvement in financial conditions can only be sustained through further policy actions that address underlying stability risks and promote continued economic recovery. continued improvement will require further balance sheet repair in the financial sector and a smooth unwinding of public and pri-vate debt overhangs. if progress in addressing these medium-term challenges falters, risks could reap-pear. the global financial crisis could morph into a more chronic phase, marked by a deterioration of financial conditions and recurring bouts of financial instability. the e uro area crisis: acute risks have declined, much work lies ahead in the euro area, acute near-term stability risks have been reduced significantly. funding conditions in the markets for sovereign, bank, and corporate debt have improved. despite this notable progress, many banks in the euro area periphery remain challenged by elevated funding costs, deteriorating asset quality, and weak profits. credit transmission remains weak in several economies, as bank balance sheet repair is uneven, while fragmentation between the core and periphery of the euro area persists. corporations in the periphery are directly affected by bank balance sheet weakness, cyclical headwinds, and, in many cases, their own debt overhangs. the analysis presented in this report suggests that the debt overhang at listed companies in the euro area periphery is sizable—up to one-fifth of debt outstanding. to limit the extent of required dele-veraging in the corporate sector, continued efforts to reduce fragmentation and lower funding costs, as well as ongoing restructuring plans to improve pro-ductivity, are essential. in addition, a combination of asset sales or cutbacks in dividends and investment may be needed to reduce debt burdens. banking challenges: deleveraging, business models, and soundness challenges banks in advanced economies have taken significant steps to restructure their balance sheets, but progress has been uneven, as systems are at different stages of repair. the process is largely completed in the united states, but it requires further efforts for some european banks. banks in the euro area periphery, in particular, face significant challenges that are impairing their ability to support economic recovery. balance sheet pressures are less acute for other european banks, but the process of de-risking and deleveraging is not complete. for banks in emerging market economies, the main challenge is to continue supporting growth while safeguard-ing against rising domestic vulnerabilities. the new market and regulatory environments are also forcing banks globally to reshape their business models to become smaller, simpler, and more focused on their home markets. rising s tability risks of accommodative monetary policies the use of unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies continues to provide essential support to aggregate demand. these policies are generating a substantial rebalancing of private investor portfolios toward riskier assets, as intended. however, a prolonged period of extraordinary monetary accommodation could push portfolio ',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2012 xiexecutive summary the analysis in this global financial stability report (gfsr) shows that, despite recent favorable developments in financial markets, risks to financial stability have increased since the april 2012 gfsr, as confidence in the global financial system has become very fragile. although significant new efforts by european policymakers have allayed investors’ big-gest fears, the euro area crisis remains the principal source of concern. tail-risk perceptions surrounding currency redenomination have fueled a retrench-ment of private financial exposures to the euro area periphery. the resulting capital flight and market fragmentation undermine the very foundations of the union: integrated markets and an effective com-mon monetary policy. the european central bank’s (ecb’s) exceptional liquidity operations around the beginning of 2012 eased the pressure on banks to shed assets, but that pressure rose again, accompanied by increasing mar-ket fragmentation. subsequently, the statement by the president of the ecb in july, and measures pro-posed by the ecb in september to increase liquid-ity support and safeguard an appropriate monetary policy transmission, have been essential in addressing investors’ biggest fears and prompted another market recovery. this gfsr updates work presented in the april 2012 report to assess the impact of bank deleveraging under three scenarios—baseline, weak, and complete policies. we find that delays in resolving the crisis have increased the expected amount of asset shrinkage at banks. the largest burden of projected credit supply contractions falls on the euro area periphery, where the combined forces of bank deleveraging and sovereign stress are generating very strong headwinds for the corporate sector. where the april 2012 gfsr found the need for euro area policymakers to build on improvements and avoid fresh setbacks, this gfsr finds that more speed is needed now. as detailed in chapter 1, a leap to the complete policies scenario is neces-sary to restore confidence, reverse capital flight, and reintegrate the euro zone. key elements at the national level include implementation of well-timed and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, structural reforms to reduce external imbalances and promote growth, and completion of the banking sector clean-up, including further steps to recapitalize or restruc-ture viable banks where necessary and to resolve nonviable banks. these national efforts need to be supported at the euro area level by sufficient funding to banks through the ecb’s liquidity framework. more fundamentally, concrete progress toward establishing a banking union in the euro area will help to break the pernicious link between sovereigns and domes-tic banks and help improve supervision. over the longer term, a successful banking union will require sufficient resource pooling to provide a credible fiscal backstop to both the bank resolution authority and a joint deposit insurance fund. the unfolding euro area crisis has generated safe-haven flows to other jurisdictions, notably the united states and japan. although these flows have pushed government funding costs to historic lows, both countries continue to face significant fiscal challenges, as assessed in chapter 2. in the united states, the looming fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling dead-line, and the related uncertainty are the main imme-diate risks. unsustainable debt dynamics remain the central medium-term concern. japan faces high deficits and record debt levels, and interdependence between banks and the sovereign is growing. in both countries, necessary steps toward medium-term fis-cal adjustment need to be laid out without further delay. the key lesson of the past few years is that imbalances need to be addressed well before markets start flagging credit concerns. emerging market economies have adeptly navigated through global shocks so far, but need to guard against potential further shockwaves while manag-ing a slowdown in growth that could raise domestic ',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2013 xi executive summary the global financial system is undergoing a series of transitions along the path toward greater financial stability. the united states may soon move to less accommodative monetary policies and higher long-term interest rates as its recovery gains ground. after a prolonged period of strong portfolio inflows, emerging markets are facing a transition to more volatile external conditions and higher risk premiums. some need to address financial and macroeconomic vulnerabilities and bolster resil-ience, as they shift to a regime in which financial sector growth is more balanced and sustainable. japan is mov-ing toward the new “abenomics” policy regime marked by more vigorous monetary easing, coupled with fiscal and structural reforms. the euro area is moving toward a more robust and safer financial sector, including a stronger monetary union with a common framework for risk mitigation, while strengthening financial systems and reducing excessive debt levels. finally, the global banking system is phasing in stronger regulatory standards. chapter 1 examines the challenges and risks of each of these transitions. the primary challenge resulting from these changes relates to managing the side effects and eventual withdrawal of accommodative monetary policy in the united states. such a transition, including the benefits of a strong u.s. economy, should help limit financial stability risks associated with an extended period of low interest rates. yet managing a smooth transition could prove challenging, as investors adjust portfolios for a new regime with higher interest rates and greater volatility. the analysis in chapter 1 highlights the risk that long-term interest rates could rise more sharply than currently anticipated. structural reductions in market liquidity and leveraged positions in short-term funding markets and the shadow banking system (for instance, in the mortgage real estate investment trust sector) could amplify these rate increases and spill over to global markets. financial stability challenges are also prevalent in many emerging market economies. bond markets are now more sensitive to changes in accommoda-tive monetary policies in advanced economies because foreign investors have crowded into local markets and may withdraw. emerging market fundamentals have weakened in recent years, after a protracted interval of credit expansion and rising corporate leverage. manag-ing the risks of the transition to a more balanced and sustainable financial sector, while maintaining robust growth and financial stability, will be a key undertak-ing confronting policymakers. as central banks elsewhere consider strategies for eventual exit from unconventional monetary poli-cies, japan is scaling up monetary stimulus under the abenomics framework, aiming to pull the economy out of its deflationary rut. successful implementation of a complete policy package that features fiscal and structural reforms would reinforce domestic financial stability, while likely boosting capital outflows. but sub-stantial risks to financial stability could accompany the program if planned fiscal and structural reforms are not fully implemented. failure to enact these reforms could lead to a return of deflation and increased bank holdings of government debt, further increasing the already-high sovereign-bank nexus. in a more disorderly scenario, with higher inflation and elevated risk premiums, the risks to both domestic and global financial stability could be greater still, including rapid rises in bond yields and volatility, and sharp increases in outflows. in the euro area, reforms implemented at the national level and important steps taken toward improving the architecture of the monetary union have helped reduce funding pressures on banks and sovereigns. however, in the stressed economies of italy, portugal, and spain, heavy corporate sector debt loads and financial fragmentation remain challenging. even if financial fragmentation is reversed over the medium term, this report estimates that a persistent debt over-hang would remain, amounting to almost one-fifth of the combined corporate debt of italy, portugal, and spain. assuming no further improvement in economic and financial conditions which would correspond to a more adverse outcome than the cyclical improvement built into the october 2013 world economic outlook baseline scenario, some banks in these economies might need to further increase provisioning to address ',\n",

disposal. yet in the event of adverse shocks, contin-gency backstops may be needed to address the risk of fire sales in some market segments and to manage orderly unwinding or liquidation. increased oversight would help reduce related risks of excessive leverage in the shadow banking system and, in particular, in the larger mortgage real estate investment trusts. •\\tfor emerging market economies, the principal trans-mission channel of external pressures is more likely to be via liquidity strains in bond and foreign exchange markets, rather than through bank funding chan-nels. in addition, the response of foreign investors to changing expectations for u.s. monetary policy will continue to affect local markets. in the event of significant capital outflows, some countries may need to focus on ensuring orderly market functioning, using their policy buffers wisely. keeping emerging market economies resilient requires increased focus on domestic vulnerabilities as relative growth prospects moderate, u.s. nominal rates rise, and capital flows recede. policymakers should carefully monitor and contain the rapid growth of corporate leverage. local bank regulators need to guard against foreign currency funding mismatches affecting bank balance sheets, including through foreign currency borrowing by companies. in addition, establishing sufficient buf-fers and addressing macroeconomic imbalances will likely prove to be worthwhile steps for cushioning against increased volatility and risk premiums. •\\tcontaining the risks to china’s financial system is as important as it is challenging. broad credit growth needs to be reined in to contain financial stability risks and promote the rebalancing of china’s econ-omy away from credit-fueled capital and property investment. it is important that prudential oversight of shadow banking activity be tightened, that incen-tives for regulatory arbitrage be removed through continued financial liberalization (for example, of deposit rates), and that the widespread belief in implicit guarantees and bailouts of risky corporate loans and saving products be counteracted. unless credit losses are taken by lenders and savers, the state faces large and unpredictable fiscal costs. •\\tjapan’s bold policies need to be completed, with the authorities following through on fiscal and structural policy commitments, to avoid downside risks. these policies are needed to contain a potential sharp rise in government bond risk premiums if sovereign debt dynamics do not improve. to help mitigate stability risks, market structures also need to be made more resilient (such as through the modification of circuit breakers in derivatives markets) and the risk profile of regional banks addressed. •\\tin the euro area, further progress in reducing debt overhangs and bolstering bank balance sheets needs to go hand in hand with a strengthened euro area financial architecture and the completion of the banking union

and transparent balance sheet assessment. credible capital backstops to meet any identified shortfalls need to be put in place and communicated in advance of the publication of results from the exercise. the corporate debt overhang should be addressed using a more comprehensive approach, including corporate debt cleanups, improvements to corporate bankruptcy frameworks, and active facilitation of nonbank sources of credit. further monetary support by the european central bank and credit support to viable firms by the european investment bank are crucial to providing time for

              " ' international monetary fund | october 2010 ixexecutive summary the setback in progress toward financial stability was precipitated by turmoil in the sovereign debt markets in europe, where increased vulnerabilities of sovereign and bank balance sheets became the focus of market concern. existing sovereign debt sustainability challenges, combined with concentrated short-term debt rollovers and an undi-versified investor base, left some euro area sovereigns vulnerable to funding pressures. these pressures spilled over to the banking sector, increasing the likelihood of a grim scenario of shrinking credit, slower growth, and weakening balance sheets. the forceful response at the national and supranational level to address sovereign risks and strengthen confidence in the financial system, including in particular through the provision of detailed information on bank balance sheets, helped to stabilize funding markets and mitigate risks, but conditions remain fragile. chapter 1 of this report presents an analysis of the challenges facing advanced countries as they deal with the juxtaposition of a slower recovery, higher debt levels and rollovers, and a still-impaired financial sector. the report starts from the premise that private and sovereign balance sheets will continue to strengthen in a gradually improving economic environment and that policy measures to address legacy problems in key banking systems are implemented alongside important stabilization policies. nonetheless, higher downside macroeconomic risks, sovereign financing pressures, and intensifying funding strains could produce a difficult environment, requiring adept policy maneuvering. in europe, coordinated support programs and the announcement of ambitious fiscal reforms in countries facing the greatest funding difficulties helped contain the turmoil in the euro area after its rapid escalation in may. nevertheless, sovereign risks remain elevated as markets continue to focus on high public debt burdens, unfavorable growth dynamics, increased rollover risks, and linkages to the banking system. second-tier institutions and banks in countries whose sovereign spreads remain under pressure continue to have only limited access to funding markets and face rising costs. although governments have put in place national and supranational backstops to ensure that the global financial system is still in a period of significant uncertainty and remains the achilles’ heel of the economic recovery. although the ongoing recovery is expected to continue under the baseline scenario, resulting in a gradual strengthening of balance sheets, progress toward global financial sta-bility has experienced a setback since the april 2010 global financial stability report (gfsr). the recent turmoil in sovereign debt markets in europe highlighted increased vulnerabilities of bank and sovereign balance sheets arising from the crisis. the financial situation has subsequently improved, owing to the forceful response by policymakers which helped to stabilize funding markets and reduce tail risk, but substantial market uncertainties persist. global output has expanded in line with earlier projections, with growth in emerging market countries particularly strong. mature economies are transitioning from temporary support to more self-sustaining private demand. nevertheless, sover-eign balance sheets are highly vulnerable to growth shocks, making debt sustainability less certain. in this context, policymakers must tackle the following key reforms in order to ensure a viable global financial system and safeguard the recovery: (1) deal with the legacy problems in the banking sector, including, where necessary, recapitalization; (2) strengthen the fundamentals of sovereign balance sheets; and (3) continue to clarify and specify regulatory reform, building on the substantial improve-ments proposed by the basel committee on banking supervision (bcbs).',\n",
              " 'x international monetary fund | october 2010markets remain open, continuing forceful policy measures are needed to remain firmly on track toward building financial system resilience. in the united states, financial stability has improved, but pockets of vulnerability remain in the banking system. although banks have been able to raise a substantial amount of capital, and expected demands appear manageable, some raising of additional capital may be needed to reverse recent deleveraging trends and possibly to comply with u.s. regulatory reforms. weakness in the real estate sector constitutes an additional challenge in the united states. to a large extent, the apparently modest capital needs of u.s. banks reflect the large scale of government-sponsored enterprises and other government interventions without which those needs would have been substantially higher. this highlights the extent to which risk has been transferred from private to public balance sheets, as well as the need to address the burden placed on public institutions. in japan, a near-term disruption in the government bond market remains unlikely. so far, the stable domestic savings base and healthy current account surplus reduce the need to attract external funding sources. over time, the factors presently supporting the japanese bond market—high private savings, home bias, and the lack of alternatives to yen-denominated assets—are expected to erode as the population ages and the workforce declines. overall, emerging markets have proven very resilient to sovereign and banking strains in advanced economies, and most have continued to enjoy access to international capital markets. cross-border spillover effects were mostly confined to regions with significant economic and financial links to the euro area. with the current slowdown in growth in advanced countries, emerging markets, in general, have become increasingly attractive to investors because of their relatively sound fundamentals and stronger growth potential. this shift in global asset allocation is likely to increase as long as this relative difference persists. however, a potential buildup of macro-financial risks stemming from strong capital inflows—including from excess demand in local markets and possible increased volatility— remains a concern for countries on the receiving end of this ongoing asset reallocation. policies to address risks policymakers in many advanced countries will need to confront the interactions created by slow growth, rising sovereign indebtedness, and still-fragile financial institutions. in addition, the foundations underpinning the new financial regulatory regime need to be put into place. address legacy problems in the banking system. confidence in the financial sector has not been fully restored. on the bright side, bank regulatory capital ratios have improved and global writedowns and loan provisions have declined. our estimate of crisis-related bank writedowns between 2007 and 2010 has fallen slightly from $2.3\\xa0trillion in the april 2010 gfsr to $2.2 trillion now, driven mainly by a fall in securities losses. in addition, banks have made further progress in recognizing those writedowns, with more than three-quarters of them already reported, leaving a residual amount of approximately $550 billion. there has been less progress, though, in deal-ing with the imminent bank funding pressures: nearly $4 trillion of bank debt will need to be rolled over in the next 24\\xa0months. as a consequence, exits from extraordinary financial system support, including the removal of government guarantees of bank debt, will have to be carefully sequenced and planned. resolving and/or restructur-ing weaker financial institutions—through closure, recapitalization, or merger—remains a priority so that funding markets can return to normal and the industry to better health. national and supranational backstops should be available to provide support where needed. strengthen the fundamentals of sovereign balance sheets. in the short term, adequate supranational support should be available to sovereign balance sheets in those countries facing immediate strains. in the medium run, sovereign balance sheets need to follow a credible path to ensure fiscal sustainability (see the october 2010 world economic outlook and the november 2010 fiscal monitor). sovereign refinancing risks should be addressed by debt management policies that lengthen the average maturity structures as market conditions permit. managing and reducing public contingent liabilities using price-based mechanisms should also be part of the plan.global financial stabilit y report sovereigns, funding, and systemic liquidity',\n",

              " ' xi    risks to global financial stability have eased as the economic recovery has gained steam, but concerns about advanced country sovereign risks could undermine stability gains and prolong the collapse of credit. without more fully restoring the health of fin ancial and household balance sheets, a worsening of public debt sustainability could be transmitted back to banking systems or across borders. hence, policies are needed to (1) reduce sovereign vulnerabilities, including through communicating credible med ium-term fiscal consolidation plans; (2) ensure that the ongoing deleveraging process unfolds smoothly; and (3) decisively move forward to complete the regulatory agenda so as to move to a safer, more resilient, and dynamic global financial system. for eme rging market countries, where the surge in capital inflows has led to fears of inflation and asset price bubbles, a pragmatic approach using a combination of macroeconomic and prudential financial policies is advisable. with the global economy improving ( see the april 2010 world economic outlook ), risks to financial stability have subsided. nonetheless, the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid accumulation of public debt have altered the global risk profile. vulnerabilities now increasingly emana te from concerns over the sustainability of governments’ balance sheets. in some cases, the longer -run solvency concerns could translate into short -term strains in funding markets as investors require higher yields to compensate for potential future risks. such strains can intensify the short term funding challenges facing advanced country banks and may have negative implications for a recovery of private credit. these interactions are covered in chapter 1 of this report. banking system health is generally improving alongside the economic recovery, continued deleveraging, and normalizing markets. our estimates of bank writedowns since the start of the crisis through 2010 have been reduced to $2.3 trillion from $2.8 trillion in the october 2009 global financ ial stability report . as a result, bank capital needs have declined substantially, although segments of banking systems in some countries remain capital deficient, mainly as a result of losses related to commercial real estate. even though capital needs ha ve fallen, banks still face considerable challenges: a large amount of short -term funding will need to be refinanced this year and next; more and higher -quality capital will likely be needed to satisfy investors in anticipation of upcoming more stringent r egulation; and not all losses have been written down to date. in addition to these challenges, new regulations will also require banks to rethink their business strategies. all of these factors are likely to put downward pressure on profitability. in such an environment, the recovery of private sector credit is likely to be subdued as credit demand is weak and supply is constrained. households and corporates need to reduce their debt levels and restore their balance sheets. even with low demand, the balloon ing sovereign financing needs may bump up against limited credit supply, which could contribute to upward pressure on',\n",

              " 'executive summary xvanother area in which weaknesses contrib uted to the crisis is financial institutions’ liquid ity management. it is now obvious that various factors may have encouraged financial institu tions to insufficiently protect themselves against an adverse liquidity event—a situation that needs to be addressed. for financial institutions, the crisis has pro vided many important lessons including those involving: liquidity risk management. firms will need to factor in more severe price jumps (“gapping”) and correlation movements in their market risk models, employing adjustments to risk measures where possible. better stress tests could be undertaken with longer periods of funding illiquidity and improved contingency plans. more transparency regarding how liquidity risk is managed within the firm could be available to investors. more realistic assumptions about the liquidity of complex structured securities. firms’ reli ance on highly structured securities to gener ate collateral proved problematic during the crisis. greater availability on balance sheets of highly liquid assets to use as collateral could allow institutions easier access to funding sources during periods of stress. financial regulators and supervisory authori ties also need to take a more active role in reviewing liquidity management issues and supervisory guidance, and considering other regulatory improvements.• strengthen existing international liquidity guidance. the basel committee’s working group on liquidity is already considering how to strengthen its existing guidance in this area, and prompt review would be welcome. the use of multiple currencies for funding globally active banks suggests that a more uni fied approach to liquidity management across countries may be needed. monitoring best practices. a better method of monitoring progress toward achieving “best practices” for liquidity management (e.g., those of the basel committee, the joint forum, and the institute of international finance) could help prevent gaps across institutions. if progress is insufficient, a pillar 2-like system may be needed, whereby supervisors are tasked with ensuring that adequate bank liquidity management systems are in place and that banks hold sufficient liquidity buffers and have well-formulated contingency plans. monetary authorities as well need to review their operational practices in light of the crisis. this event has required unprecedented liquidity infusions to the interbank market and the use of operational instruments that had not been used before. central banks should now converge to policies that have worked during the crisis to improve the functioning of interbank markets and better distribute liquidity. such policies to be considered are the following : broader range of collateral. to be expedi ent, central banks need to be able to oper ate with a wide range of collateral, perhaps agreeing on collateral that could be posted at multiple central banks. however, central banks will need to have a well-established collateral pricing policy to avoid taking undue credit and liquidity risks onto their own balance sheets. wide group of counterparties. central banks should have a wide group of counterparty banks established during normal times that are eligible to receive liquidity during stressful times. altering this group during periods of stress can signal that certain banks, with per haps newly acceptable collateral, are receiving preferential treatment. maturity structure of liquidity provision. operational procedures enabling the provi sion of liquidity at different maturities can be helpful. however, altering the maturity profile of the central bank’s balance sheet needs to be accompanied by communication indicat ing how this is consistent with the monetary policy strategy. better coordination among financial over seers. central banks and others with over sight over financial institutions could usefully develop closer ties and improved information ',\n",

              " 'ixix since the april 2007 global financial stability report (gfsr), global ﬁ nancial stability has endured an important test. credit and market risks have risen and markets have become more volatile. markets are recognizing the extent to which credit discipline has dete-riorated in recent years—most notably in the u.s. nonprime mortgage and leveraged loan markets, but also in other related credit markets. this has prompted a retrenchment from some risky assets and deleveraging, causing a widening of credit spreads in riskier asset classes and more volatile bond and equity markets. the absence of prices and secondary markets for some structured credit products, and concerns about the location and size of potential losses, has led to disruptions in some money markets and funding difﬁ culties for a number of ﬁ nancial institutions, as some counterparties have been reluctant to extend credit to those thought to hold lower quality, illiquid assets. the resulting disruption has required extraordinary liquidity injections by a number of central banks to facilitate the orderly functioning of these markets. the potential consequences of this episode should not be underestimated and the adjust-ment process is likely to be protracted. credit conditions may not normalize soon, and some of the practices that have developed in the structured credit markets will have to change. at the same time, the global economy entered this turbulent period exhibiting solid growth, especially in emerging market countries. systemically important ﬁ nancial institutions began this episode with adequate capital to manage the likely level of credit losses. so far, despite the signiﬁ cant ongoing correction in ﬁ nancial markets, global growth remains solid, though some slowdown could be expected. downside risks have increased signiﬁ cantly and, even if those risks fail to materialize, the implications of this period of turbulence will be signiﬁ cant and far reaching. eventually, lessons for both the private sector and the regulatory and supervisory arenas will have to be drawn in order to strengthen the ﬁ nancial system against future strains. the threat to ﬁ nancial stability increased as the uncertainty became manifest in the money markets that provide short-term ﬁ nancing (especially commercial paper markets). at the center of the turmoil is a funding mismatch whereby medium-term, illiquid, and hard-to-value assets, such as structured credit securities, were being funded by very short-term money market securities—often asset-backed commercial paper. the market illiquidity and the difﬁ culty in valuing the complex, structured products held as assets has compounded the risks of the funding mismatch. thus, while potentially helping protect the ﬁ nancial system from concentrations of credit risk in banks, the dispersal of struc-tured credit products has substantially increased uncertainty about the extent of the risks and where they are ultimately held. this funding mismatch was undertaken by a signiﬁ cant number of conduits and special purpose vehicles that had assumed they could hold their illiquid assets to maturity. many have been associated with regulated banks, and to a large extent their funding strategies were backed by contingent liquidity lines from those banks. when doubts about the quality of some of the underlying assets emerged and the high ratings were perceived as less reliable, prices of the assets fell, the rollover of associated asset-backed commercial paper became very difﬁ cult, and funding began to be squeezed. as a consequence, what had been contingent, off-balance-sheet liabilities for regulated banks threatened to move “on balance sheet.” the funding difﬁ culties were ﬁ rst felt in europe and, subsequently, in a number of other places. the rapid transmission of disturbances in one part of the ﬁ nancial system to other parts, sometimes executive summary',\n",
              " 'executive summary xthrough opaque and intertwined channels, has surprised both market participants and the ofﬁ cial sector. the uncertainty about where off- balance-sheet bank exposures will materialize next has led to a tiering of interbank lending rates. banks that are believed to either have structured credit product losses, or that need to satisfy contingent credit lines to their con-duits or special purpose vehicles, face higher interbank rates. in some cases, the ﬂ ows in the interbank market are stymied by some large banks’ desire to hold onto liquidity in case they need to ﬁ nance other activities, such as the large pipeline of leveraged buyouts scheduled for the remainder of the year. overall, there has been a sharp rise in perceived counterparty risk, and a desire to keep the additional liquidity on hand, at least for now. the april 2007 gfsr ﬂ agged the underlying causes of the current correction. the weakening of credit discipline and the potential complacency, which were highlighted in that edition, led to a buildup of credit risks in the u.s. mortgage market, leveraged buyout market, and some lending to emerging markets. the benign economic and ﬁ nancial conditions of recent years weakened incentives to conduct due dili-gence on borrowers and counterparties. moreover the “originate and distribute” model used for credit products by many ﬁ nancial institutions meant that many such institutions could choose not to hold the credit risk they originated, reducing their incentives to monitor borrowers. investors in the distributed securities may have relaxed their due diligence in assessing liquidity and leverage risks or chosen to rely excessively on ratings agencies to analyze risks in complex ﬁ nancial instruments. stress in the u.s. housing market then weakened mortgage-backed securities, an important component of the global ﬁ nancial system. the resulting multiple credit downgrades of these securities by ratings agen-cies led to downward pressure on their prices and started to deepen the repricing episode that began some time ago. leverage has played a key role in amplifying the disturbances. the ease with which some banks and other investment vehicles, including hedge funds, were able to borrow against difﬁ cult-to-price collateral traded in illiquid markets severely aggravated conditions when market liquidity evaporated, resulting in a process of forced deleveraging at “ﬁ re sale” prices and the failure of some funds. institutions that have suffered the most have had strategies that were based on high levels of leverage and had assumed continued liquidity in secondary markets. a long period of abnormally low market volatility likely exacerbated the episode. risk premia in many markets had fallen to histori-cally low levels as more and more investors bet on a continuation of the benign, low-volatility environment. returns became more correlated. as markets fell, risk premia expanded quickly. similar risk management techniques, common investors, and similar positions may have exac-erbated the situation. losses were magniﬁ ed as many market participants tried to exit similar positions simultaneously. chapter 1 of this report summarizes the overall assessment of stability using the global ﬁ nancial stability map introduced in the april 2007 gfsr. extending the work in the last gfsr, the chapter focuses on the fallout from weakening credit discipline in the u.s. nonprime mort-gage market and the leveraged buyout market (including the market turbulence of august 2007, which resulted in a drying up of term lending in money markets), and details linkages across markets. the chapter explains how volatil-ity has been ampliﬁ ed by high leverage and how risks are transmitted between institutions. it gathers evidence on where the risks now reside, and what might be the impact on banks, corporations, and households as losses surface. the chapter also examines the global aspects of the lack of credit discipline. overall, emerg-ing market risks remain ﬁ nely balanced, with many countries beneﬁ ting from improved macroeconomic fundamentals and better policymaking frameworks. external sovereign debt has been reduced and debt structures are better managed. nonetheless, offsetting these posi-tive aspects, credit growth has been rapid in a ',\n",

              " 'executive summary xiifacilitating origination. in periods of turbulence, the rapid downgrades then raise questions about the reliability of these ratings and their usefulness for the investors. we repeat the call from the april 2006 gfsr for a more differentiated scale of ratings for structured products. inves-tors also have an obligation and responsibility to understand the dynamics and liquidity risks asso-ciated with the products they buy—they wrongly assumed that a low probability of default meant a low likelihood of losses from market movements. in the case of complex structured credit products, investors need to look behind the ratings—they should not assume that the simple letter ratings provided by ratings agencies show equivalent risks as those for other asset classes. differentiation and transparency in the underly-ing assumptions and construction of the various structures would facilitate appropriate due diligence by investors. fourth, the valuation of complex products in the context of a market where liquidity is insuf-ﬁ cient to provide reliable market prices requires more consideration. when purchasing complex products, investors will need to consider the asso-ciated liquidity aspects and include an appropri-ate liquidity risk “premium” as part of the price. financial institutions holding such securities as collateral will need to assign a “haircut” that factors in liquidity characteristics. importantly, ﬁ nancial institutions need to make sure that they have robust funding strategies appropriately suited for their business model and that such funding strategies can accommodate stressful conditions. more generally, the rapid growth of some illiquid instruments raises questions about whether originators of such securities should be expected to provide secondary markets to contribute to the valuation process. fifth, the relevant perimeter of risk consolidation for banks has proved to be larger than the usual accounting or legal perimeters. there are two notable examples: (1) reputational risk may force banks to internalize losses of legally independent entities; and (2) new instruments or structures may mask off-balance-sheet or contingent liabilities. the result is that risks that appear to have been distributed may yet return in various forms to the banks that distributed them. the relevant perimeter is not only an issue for supervisors, but also for the ﬁ nancial institutions themselves—their risk management systems, audit processes and internal oversight and governance structures. policymakers now face a delicate balancing act. they must establish frameworks that encour-age investors to maintain high credit standards and strengthen risk management systems in good times as well as bad. actions should only be undertaken if the public policy beneﬁ ts outweigh the costs, taking care to thoroughly examine pos-sible unintended consequences. in general, the current regulatory systems have proven resilient to date, and regulators must be continually mindful that households and ﬁ rms have beneﬁ ted greatly from the ﬁ nancial innovation and solid growth and ﬁ nancial stability of recent years. * * * chapters 2 and 3 examine two respective issues that are the outcome of the lengthy period of low mature market yields and unusu-ally low ﬁ nancial market volatility over the last several years. chapter 2 examines the extent to which market risk management methods may have encouraged more risk-taking during this relatively benign period, perhaps resulting in a more rapid withdrawal from risky assets than would otherwise be the case as conditions change. in light of rapid capital ﬂ ows to emerging market countries, chapter 3 investigates how countries can best deal with capital ﬂ ow volatility in the medium term by improving the depth, liquidity, and institutional quality of their domes-tic ﬁ nancial markets. chapter 2 speciﬁ cally examines market risk management techniques to see whether their common usage, while seemingly prudent for individual institutions, could exacerbate mar-ket volatility during periods of stressful market conditions. the question is examined in two ways. the ﬁ rst is by using a stylized version of the most common market risk model, value-atrisk (var), which is the estimated loss a ﬁ rm is ',\n",
              " 'executive summary xiiiunlikely to exceed at a given degree of conﬁ dence. for instance, a ﬁ rm’s one-day estimated var of $10 million at a conﬁ dence level of 95 percent implies that the ﬁ rm would expect to lose more than $10 million on its portfolio only ﬁ ve days out of 100. a stylized model is used to demonstrate how var declines during a lower volatility environment, but rises when higher volatility returns. the stylized portfolios are then “stressed” by examining how var would respond with data from previous episodes of ﬁ nancial market turbulence. lastly, simulations are con-ducted in which several ﬁ rms are hypothesized to use the same, or slightly different, var mod-els, also during periods of stress. results suggest that such ﬁ rms, acting according to their own models to contain risks, could collectively make markets more volatile, especially if risk aversion is low. the simulations also show, however, that a greater diversity of models would help to reduce such potential instability. chapter 2 also examines risk management procedures of investment banks and hedge funds to see whether they conform to the preconditions necessary to amplify market volatility in practice. while all ﬁ rms maintain that they would not rigidly follow their var models in stressful circumstances, there are a number of ways in which var metrics, or related risk limits, could act to amplify market volatility. in fact, recent turbulence suggests some of these techniques may be contributing to the current turbulent conditions to some degree. overall, var and other risk management techniques will encourage ﬁ nancial institutions to respond more rapidly to changes in risk. normally, this will facilitate early detection and prompt cor-rection of risks deemed excessive by the institution. however, the use of similar techniques across institutions during periods of stress can lead to larger price movements than would occur if different techniques were used. it is thus worthwhile for regulators and supervisors to acknowledge the beneﬁ ts of discretion when implementing risk management systems (including new ways to incorporate credit and liquidity risks) and to promote the use of “stress testing”—encouraging all ﬁ rms to consider their interactive effects during periods of stress, as some do already. a diversity of investment positions and types of participants is even more important to help stabilize markets. regulators and supervisors would also do well to consider more concretely than they do now how they would respond to the amplifying effects when individual ﬁ rms naturally attempt to protect their ﬁ rm’s franchise value. chapter 3 empirically analyzes a common view—whether, in addition to strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a well-functioning domestic ﬁ nancial market encourages capital inﬂ ows and reduces their volatility over the medium term. a panel estimation technique is used to examine the factors that determine the volume and volatility of annual capital inﬂ ows for a sample of developed and emerging market economies from 1977 to 2006. the factors include ﬁ nancial variables such as equity market depth and liquidity and ﬁ nancial openness, and a shorter sample also includes institutional quality variables such as corporate governance quality and accounting standards. the results of the empirical work show that the liquidity of equity markets and ﬁ nancial openness positively inﬂ uence the level of capital inﬂ ows. moreover, the panel estimations show that more ﬁ nancial openness reduces the volatility of inﬂ ows. separately, the chapter shows that improvements in a broad set of institutional quality variables are correlated with lower volatility. chapter 3 also examines how ﬁ ve emerging market countries have coped with the recent rise in capital inﬂ ows and discusses some of their policy options. these ﬁ ve country examples reveal the difﬁ culty of ﬁ nding a common set of ﬁ nancial policies that help deal with capital inﬂ ows. generally, policies that encourage ﬁ nancial market development over the medium term—including a well-regulated system, better transparency and broader institutional quality, and improved risk management for ﬁ nancial institutions—will likely cushion the ﬁ nancial system from the potentially destabilizing effects of abrupt capital outﬂ ows better than will short-term ﬁ xes.',\n",
              " 'ixix executive summary favorable global economic prospects, particularly strong momentum in the euro area and in emerging markets led by china and india, continue to serve as a strong foundation for global ﬁnancial stability. however, some mar-ket developments warrant attention, as underly-ing ﬁnancial risks and conditions have shifted since the september 2006 global financial stability report (gfsr). through the use of a new global ﬁnancial stability map, chapter i charts principal near-term risks. chapters ii and iii examine the ﬁnancial stability implications of two longer-term trends: the changing investor base from which global capital ﬂows are sourced, and the glo-balization of ﬁnancial institutions, particularly banks. the changing mix of assets, source countries, and types of cross-border investors identiﬁed in chapter ii should, for the most part, help to sta-bilize global markets. but the secular trend has been reinforced by low interest rates and by low volatility in many mature markets, with investors seeking higher-yielding assets in some emerg-ing markets and other mature markets. chapter i examines this investor strategy—the carry trade—noting that while countries’ fundamen-tals have improved and sovereign external debt has become less risky, international issuance of corporate debt and equities has risen rapidly to accommodate investor demand. a theme of chapter iii—that the globalization of banks may help reduce individual bank risk but may not necessarily enhance the resil-ience of ﬁnancial systems as a whole—is also echoed in chapter i, which examines possible spillovers from a deterioration in credit quality in the u.s. subprime mortgage market. chapter i identiﬁes several short-term risks. first, the subprime segment of the u.s. housing market is showing signs of credit quality deterio-ration. while the fallout to date has been lim-ited, there is scope for it to deepen and spread to other markets, possibly to structured mort-gage credit products held by a variety of global investors. fortunately, the economic impact of the housing market slowdown has been limited and some market indicators have begun to sta-bilize, suggesting that the ﬁnancial effects may also be contained. second, low interest rates and healthy corporate balance sheets have spurred an increase in private equity buyouts. this has led to a sub-stantial rise in leverage in the acquired ﬁrms, potentially making such ﬁrms more vulnerable to economic shocks. the increased use of lever-aged loans as part of ﬁnancing also poses risks to some intermediaries that provide bridge ﬁnancing to leveraged-buyout transactions. the situation bears careful attention, especially if a large high-proﬁle deal runs into difﬁculty, as this could trigger a wider reappraisal of the risks involved. third, capital inﬂows to some emerging markets have risen rapidly, in part reﬂecting improved economic fundamentals, but also reﬂecting the search for yield given low interest rates in most mature markets. in general, strong private capital inﬂows are to be welcomed, as they reﬂect a reallocation of capital to more productive investments. however, the shift to private sector debt ﬂows, especially bank-based ﬂows into emerging europe and portfolio ﬂows into other regions, including sub-saharan africa, shows that foreign investors are taking more risk and an abrupt reversal cannot be ruled out. finally, while the downside risk from a possible disorderly unwinding of global imbalances has receded somewhat, it remains a concern. the larger role of ﬁxed-income inﬂows in ﬁnancing the u.s. current account deﬁcit indi-cates that inﬂows into u.s. bond markets may have become more sensitive to changes in world interest rate differentials.

              " 'executive summary xagainst the backdrop of continued global growth, none of the individually identiﬁed risks by themselves threaten ﬁnancial stability. how-ever, with volatility across asset classes close to historic lows and spreads on a variety of credit instruments tight, investors may not have ade-quately factored in the possibility that a “volatil-ity shock” may be ampliﬁed given the increased linkages across products and markets. institu-tions may well be acting in accordance with their own incentives, but collectively their behavior may cause a buildup of investment positions in certain markets, possibly resulting in a disor-derly correction when conditions change. for instance, the rapid growth of some innovative instruments, the rise in leverage in parts of the ﬁnancial system, and the growth of carry trades suggest that market participants are expecting a continuation of the low volatility environment and that a sustained rise in volatility could per-turb a wide range of markets. chapter ii examines the recent acceleration in the accumulation of international assets as well as the investors behind rising cross-border ﬂows. as noted above, ﬂows and stocks of cross-border claims have increased both in absolute size and relative to the volume of domestic economic activity. the diversity of assets, source countries, and investor types now involved in cross-border asset accumulation suggests more stable ﬂows. however, for some countries, the sharp increase in capital inﬂows has contributed to rapid credit growth and asset price inﬂa-tion, at times complicating the conduct of poli-cies. furthermore, foreign investors have been venturing into markets previously regarded as excessively risky for outsiders, encouraged by the generally benign ﬁnancial environment. policymakers can take advantage of these secular changes and at the same time minimize pockets of vulnerabilities that have become apparent. recipient countries have to con-tinue to establish a track record of credible macroeconomic policies. vulnerabilities can be reduced by promoting efﬁciency, stability, and the effective regulation of domestic capital mar-kets (including the development of local debt markets) so as to increase their attractiveness to a stable investor base. liberalization of capital outﬂows from domestic investors, though not a panacea, may help balance the effects of capital inﬂows and allow domestic investors to better manage their risk. chapter iii examines the implications of the accelerating globalization of ﬁnancial institutions––particularly banks––for global ﬁnancial stability. the institutional and regional pattern of globalization is remarkably varied. for large banks, greater geographical disper-sion of assets and revenues tends to be associ-ated with better share price performance and lower default risks. however, while cross-border diversiﬁcation seems to be associated positively with the stability of the individual institution, the ﬁnancial system as a whole may not be more stable, with the potential for linkages among markets and activities having increased. this is an especially important result for countries in regions with heavy foreign bank penetration across correlated economies. the chapter highlights two clear priorities to help to contain the potential contagion risk arising from institutional globalization while maximizing its beneﬁts. first, supervisors need to collaborate ever more closely in the oversight of cross-border institutions. second, authorities need to continue improving crisis management procedures with the counterparts with whom they share the greatest overlapping responsi-bilities and interests. while the jurisdiction of supervisors and regulators remains predomi-nantly domestic, at odds with the scope of activi-ties of global institutions, these practical steps can go some way toward addressing the chal-lenges to ﬁnancial stability posed by institutional globalization.',\n",

              " ' international monetary fund | april 2011 xiexecutive summary global financial stability has improved over the past six months, bolstered by better macroeconomic performance and continued accommodative macroeconomic policies (see the april 2011 world economic outlook), but fragilities remain. the two-speed recovery—modest in advanced econo-mies and robust in emerging market economies—has posed different policy challenges for countries. in advanced economies hit hardest by the crisis, govern-ments and households remain heavily indebted, to varying degrees, and the health of financial institutions has not recovered in tandem with the overall economy. emerging market economies are facing new challenges associated with strong domestic demand, rapid credit growth, relatively accommodative macroeconomic pol-icies, and large capital inflows. geopolitical risks could also threaten the economic and financial outlook, with oil prices increasing sharply amid fears of supply disruptions in the middle east and north africa. the main task facing policymakers in advanced economies is to shift the balance of policies away from reliance on macroeconomic and liquidity support to more structural policies—less “leaning” and more “cleaning” of the financial system. this will entail reducing leverage and restoring market discipline, while avoiding financial or economic disruption during the transition. thus, ongoing policy efforts to withdraw (implicit) public guarantees and ensure bondholder liability for future losses must build on more rapid progress toward stron-ger bank balance sheets, ensuring medium-term fiscal sustainability and addressing excessive debt burdens in the private sector. for policymakers in emerging market economies, the task is to limit overheating and a buildup of vulnerabilities—to avoid “cleaning” later. emerging mar-ket economies have continued to benefit from strong growth relative to that in advanced economies, accom-panied by increasing portfolio capital inflows. this is putting pressure on some financial markets, contribut-ing to higher leverage, potential asset price bubbles, and inflationary pressures. policymakers will have to pay increasing attention to containing the buildup of macrofinancial risks to avoid future problems that could inhibit their growth and damage financial stability. in a number of cases, this will entail a tighter macroeconomic policy stance, and, when needed, the use of macroprudential tools to ensure financial stability. increasing the financial sector’s capacity to absorb higher flows through efforts to broaden and deepen local capital markets will also help. in the next few months, the most pressing challenge is the funding of banks and sovereigns, particularly in some vulnerable euro area countries. as detailed in chapter 1 of this global financial stability report, policies aimed at fiscal consolidation and strengthening bank balance sheets in these countries should be sup-ported by credible assurances that multilateral backstops are sufficiently flexible and endowed to facilitate an orderly deleveraging without triggering further fiscal or bank funding strains. in other countries, funding is less problematic, but still a concern. under a baseline scenario, higher funding costs and a rising government debt stock will cause government interest payments to increase in most advanced economies (see also the april 2011 fiscal monitor). if deficit reduction continues as projected, the interest costs should generally remain manageable, although much greater progress on medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies will be needed in both the united states and japan to avoid downside risks to financial stability and to preserve confidence. in japan, the immediate fiscal priority is to support reconstruction following the earthquake, returning in due course to progress toward mediumterm consolidation goals. overall, despite the transfer of risks from the private to the public sector during the crisis, confidence in the banking systems of many advanced economies has not been restored and continues to interact adversely with the sovereign risks in the euro area. analysis presented in this report suggests that in order to restore market confidence and reduce excessive reliance on central bank funding, considerable further strengthening of euro area bank balance sheets will be needed. this will require higher capital levels, if a detrimental ',\n",
              " 'xii international monetary fund | april 2011process of deleveraging is to be avoided, and a set of mostly smaller banks will have to be restructured and, where necessary, resolved. in the united states, a lackluster housing market, legacy mortgage problems, and a backlog of foreclosures continue to put pressure on the banking system, limiting credit creation and a return to a fully functioning mortgage market. larger bank capital buffers and strengthened balance sheets will also be necessary as countries transition to a new and more demanding regulatory regime. countries in which banking systems are still struggling should enhance transparency (including through more rigorous and realistic stress tests) and recapitalize, restructure, and (if necessary) close weak institutions. without these longer-term financial sector reforms, short-term funding difficulties may escalate into another systemic liquidity event. measuring and mitigating systemic liquidity risks should be at the forefront of the agenda of policymak-ers. those risks were a main feature of the latest crisis and have yet to be addressed. chapter 2 takes a close look at this topic, examining the role that basel iii liquidity requirements will play when they are intro-duced. the analysis suggests that, while helping to raise liquidity buffers, basel iii will be unable to fully address the systemic nature of liquidity risk. the chap-ter provides some illustrative techniques for measuring systemic liquidity risk and firms’ contribution to it, and suggests some accompanying macroprudential tools that could, after further refinement and testing, be used to mitigate such risks. for instance, one of the approaches provides a way to gauge, based on a firm’s assets and liabilities and its interbank connections, the higher capital needed to ensure that its risk of insolvency does not cause a destabilizing liquidity run during stressful periods. tools of this type would allow for more effective sharing of the private-public burden of systemic liquidity risk and help reduce central bank interventions during periods of stress. a common feature of the crisis in many countries was excessive and misallocated credit growth, which helped fuel housing market booms. chapter 3 examines the connections between the housing finance systems and financial stability, noting that the structure of some countries’ housing finance systems led to a deeper housing bust and financial instability. the chapter suggests a set of best practices for hous-ing finance. for the united states, where the housing market and its financing are still problematic, these best practices imply that there should be better-defined and more transparent government participation in the housing market, including a diminished role of the two large government-sponsored entities (freddie mac and fannie mae). these goals will need to be pursued incrementally, while taking into account the still-weak housing market and economic recovery. economies seeking to create a strong housing finance system are advised to “go back to basics”—ensuring safe loan origination and encourag-ing simple and transparent mortgage contracts. global financial stabilit y report durable financial stability: getting there from here',\n",
              " 'xv prospects for the road ahead the immediate outlook for the financial system has improved markedly since the april 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) and extreme tail risks have abated. financial markets have rebounded, emerging market risks have eased, banks have raised capital, and wholesale funding markets have reopened. even so, credit channels are still impaired and the economic recovery is likely to be slow. chapter 1 first chronicles the path toward reestablishing sound credit intermediation and the near-term risks that could interrupt its restoration, includ-ing the rising burden of sovereign financing. the chapter then examines how near-term policies should be managed to provide a secure backdrop for economic recovery and a withdrawal of extraordinary public support to the financial system. some medium-term policy options are also discussed that aim to reshape the financial landscape. extreme systemic risks have abated, but complacency about banking system repair is still a concern. a key question addressed is whether the financial system can provide sufficient credit to sustain an economic recovery. recently, bank balance sheets have benefited from capital-raising efforts and positive earnings. nonethe-less, there are still serious concerns that credit deterioration will continue to put pressure on banks’ balance sheets. our analysis suggests that u.s. banks are more than halfway through the loss cycle to 2010, whereas in europe loss recog-nition is less advanced, reflecting differences in the economic cycle. while stronger bank earnings are supporting capital levels, they are not expected to fully off-set writedowns over the next 18 months. more-over, steady-state earnings are likely to be lower in the post-crisis environment. stronger action to address impaired assets will help bolster bank earning capability and support lending. executive summary systemic risks have been substantially reduced following unprecedented policy actions and nascent signs of improvement in the real economy. there is growing confidence that the global economy has turned the corner, underpinning the improvements in financial markets. nonetheless, the risk of a reintensification of the adverse feedback loop between the real and financial sectors remains significant as long as banks remain under strain and households and financial institutions need to reduce leverage. although indicators of sovereign risk are lower than six months ago, the transfer of financial risks to fiscal authorities, combined with the financing burden of fiscal stimulus, has raised concerns over crowding out the private sector and the sustainability of public sector finances. these vulnerabilities underscore the need to strengthen financial intermediation, restore health to the financial system, and eventually reduce the private risks now borne by sovereign balance sheets. great care in disengaging from public support will be necessary to avoid either sparking a second-ary crisis through premature withdrawal or endangering monetary and fiscal credibility through a belated exit. complacency now becomes a risk—banking system problems could go unresolved and much-needed regulatory reforms may be delayed or diluted. policymakers should promptly provide a plan for the future regulatory framework that mitigates the buildup of systemic risks, grounds expectations, and underpins confidence, thereby contributing to sustained economic growth.',\n",

              " 'executive summary xviiin redesigning regulation and market practices, the benefits of transferring credit risk outside the banking system and the ability of lenders to diversify funding sources need to be retained. the chapter suggests that a robust private securitization market requires policy action in several areas, including credit rating agency oversight, accounting practices, capital charges, and retention policies. this action needs to be coordinated across regulators within a country and internationally. the chapter illustrates the potential dangers of uncoordinated responses by examining the impact of retention policies and capital requirements imposed on origina-tors and shows that these could, in some cases, fail to encourage screening and monitoring or, in other cases, make securitization prohibitively expensive. undertaking careful impact studies before introducing new regulations should ensure that their interaction and potential for damaging unintended consequences is recog-nized in advance. the chapter also examines the benefits and costs of issuing covered bonds, in which the loan cash flows are pooled but kept on the balance sheet of the issuing entity. this method has the advantage that the issuer has an incentive to screen and monitor the loans, but because they remain on the issuer’s balance sheet, capital must still be held against them, reducing the benefits of securitization. none-theless, the advantages of capital-market-type financing—selling the bonds to investors—al-lows more intermediation to occur. on balance, the chapter concludes that this model, too, should be encouraged with appropriate legisla-tion and regulation. policies needed to underpin financial system recovery and reform the policy response to dislocations in funding and credit markets has been unprecedented and, though definitive conclusions are difficult to make on the longer-term benefits, the initial evidence is generally positive. chapter 3 takes an early look at the very short-term impact and more medium-term effects of conventional and unconventional policy responses, including whether they stabilized financial markets at the time of their announcement. some unconventional policies have provided support better than others. the chapter looks at the impact of intervention announcements made by 13 advanced economies. those aimed at supporting liquidity were most effective prior to the lehman broth-ers event, but were less so once it was evident that the financial crisis had become one of solvency rather than liquidity risk in a number of countries. correspondingly, announcements of capital injections were most effective in reducing the default risk of banks in the post-lehman period, as was the announcement of the potential use of asset purchases. another important result is that interventions aimed at domestic institutions or markets had important spillover effects to other countries, with mag-nitudes sometimes larger than in the home country. this underlines the critical importance of coordinating policy responses.  although it is too soon to gauge with confidence the longer-term effects of these policy actions, initial evidence suggests that some facilities have been effective in supporting fund-ing and issuance activity. examples include the bank liability guarantees introduced in several countries, the u.s. term asset-backed securi-ties loan facility with its impact on secondary market spreads and issuance of consumer assetbacked securities, and the european central bank’s decision to purchase covered bonds outright, which helped to lower spreads and reenergize issuance. it is too early to withdraw official support policies, but a strategy for disengagement is needed. while the time is not ripe for a full-fledged disengagement from all the unconventional policies undertaken—indeed in some countries additional public resources may still be need-ed—it is time for policymakers to consider and articulate how and in what sequence policies ',\n",

              " 'xi   the global financial system remains under severe str ess as the crisis broadens to include households, corporations, and the banking sectors in both advanced and emerging market countries. shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending. thus, credit growth is slowing, and even turning negative, adding even more downward pressure on econ omic activity. substantial private sector adjustment and public support packages are already being implemente d and are contributing to some early signs of stabilization. even so, further decisive and effective policy actions and international coordination are needed to sustain this improvement, to restore public confidence in financial institutions, and to normalize conditions in markets. the key challenge is to break the downward spiral between the financial system and the global economy. promising efforts are already under way for the redesign of the global fina ncial system that should provide a more stable and resilient platform for sustained economic growth.  to mend the financial sector, policies are need ed to remove strains in funding markets for banks and corporates, repair bank balance sheets, restore cross-border capital flows (particularly to emerging market countries); and limit the unintend ed side effects of the policies being implemented to combat the crisis. all these objectives will re quire strong political commitment under difficult circumstances and further enhancement of in ternational cooperation. such international commitment and determination to address the challenges posed by the crisis are growing, as displayed by the outcome of the g-20 summit in early april. without a thorough cleansing of banks’ balan ce sheets of impaired assets, accompanied by restructuring and, where needed, r ecapitalization, risks remain that banks’ problems will continue to exert downward pressure on economic activity. though subject to a number of assumptions, our best estimate of writedowns on u.s. -originated assets to be suffered by all holders since the outbreak of the crisis until 2010 has increased from $2.2 trillion in the january 2009 global financial stability report (gfsr) update to $2.7 trillion, largely as a result of the worsening base-case scenario for economic growth. in this gfsr, estimates for writ edowns have been extended to include other mature market-originated assets and, while the information underpinning these scenarios is more uncertain, such estimates suggest writedowns coul d reach a total of around $4 trillion, about twothirds of which would be incurred by banks.  there has been some improvement in interbank markets over the last few months, but funding strains persist and banks’ access to l onger-term funding as maturities come due is diminished. while in many juri sdictions banks can now issue go vernment-guaranteed, longer-term debt, their funding gap remains large. as a result , many corporations are unable to obtain banksupplied working capital and some are having difficulty raising longer-term debt, except at much more elevated yields. ',\n",
              " ' xii a wide range of nonbank financia l institutions has come under strain during the crisis as asset prices have fallen. pension funds have been hi t hard—their assets have rapidly declined in value while the lower government bond yields that many use to disc ount their liabilities have simultaneously expanded their degree of underf unding. life insurance companies have suffered losses on equity and corporate bond holdings, in some cases significantly depl eting their regulatory capital surpluses. while perhaps most of these institutions managed their risks prudently, some took on more risk without fully appreciating that potential stressful episodes may lie ahead. the retrenchment from foreign markets is now outpacing the overall de leveraging process, with a sharp decline of cross-border funding intensifying the crisis in several emerging market countries. indeed, the withdrawal of foreign invest ors and banks together with the collapse in export markets create funding pr essures in emerging mark et economies that require urgent attention. the refinancing needs of emerging markets are large, es timated at some $1.6 trillion in 2009, with the bulk coming from corporates, including financial instit utions. though notoriously difficult to forecast, current estimates are that net private capital flow s to emerging markets will be negative in 2009, and that inflows are not likely to return to their pre-crisis levels in the future. already, emerging market economies that have relied on such flows are weakening, increasing the importance of compensatory official support. despite unprecedented official initiatives to stop the downward spiral in advanced economies—including massive amounts of fiscal support and an array of liquidity facilities—further determined policy action will be required to help restore confiden ce and to relieve the financial markets of the uncertainties that are underminin g the prospects for an ec onomic recovery. however, the transfer of financial risks from the private to the public sector poses challenges. there are continuing concerns about unintended distortion s and whether the short-term stimulus costs, including open-ended bank support packages, will combine with longer-term pressures from aging populations to put strong upward pressure on government debt burdens in some advanced economies. home bias is also setting in as offi cials are encouraging banks to lend locally and consumers to keep their spending domestically oriented. these risks, discussed in chapter 1, represent some of the most difficult issues that the public sector has faced in half a century. we out line below what we believe are the key elements to break the downward spiral between the financial sector and the real economy.  immediate policy recommendations even if policy actions are taken expeditiously and implemented as intended, the deleveraging process will be slow and painful, with the ec onomic recovery likely to be protracted. the accompanying deleveraging and ec onomic contraction are estimated to cause credit growth in the united states, united kingdom, and euro area to contract and even turn negative in the near term and only recover after a number of years. this difficult outlook argues for assertive impl ementation of already-established policies and more decisive action on the policy front where needed. the political support for such action, however, is waning as the public is becoming disillu sioned by what it perceive s as abuses of taxpayer funds in some headline cases. there is a real risk that governments will be reluctant to allocate enough resources to solve the problem. moreover, uncertainty about political reactions may undermine the likelihood that the private sector will c onstructively engage in finding orderly solutions to financial stress. hence, an important component to restoring conf idence will be clarity, consistency, and the reliability of policy responses. past episodes of financia l crisis have shown that restoring the banking system to normal operation ta kes several years, and that recessions tend to be deeper and longer lasting when associated with a financial crisis (see chapter 3 of the april 2009 world economic outlook). this same experience s hows that when policies are unclear and not ',\n",
              " '  executive summary implemented forcefully and promptly, or are not aimed at the underlying problem, the recovery process is even more delayed and the costs, both in terms of taxpayer mo ney and economic activity, are even greater. given the global reach of this crisis, the effect of national policies ca n be strengthened if implemented in a coordinated fashion among aff ected countries. coordination and collaboration should build upon the positive momentum created by the recent g-20 summit, and is particularly important with respect to financ ial policies to avoid adverse inte rnational spillovers from national actions. specifically, cross-border coordination that results in a more consistent approach to address banking system problems, including dealing with ba d assets, is more likely to build confidence and avoid regulatory arbitrage and competitive distortions. in the short run, the three priorities identified in previous gfsrs and explicitly recognized in the february 2009 g-7 communiqué remain appropr iate: (i) ensure that the banking system has access to liquidity; (ii) identify and deal with im paired assets; and (iii) recapitalize weak but viable institutions and promptly resolve nonviable banks. in general, the first task is for central banks, while the latter two are the responsibility of supervisors and governments. progress has been made in the first area, but policy initiatives in the other two areas appear to be more piecemeal and reactive to circumstances. recent announcements by authorities in various countries recognize the need to deal with problem assets and to asse ss banks’ resilience to the furthe r deteriorating global economy in order to determine recapitalization needs. these are welcome steps and as details become available will likely help reduce uncertainty and public skepti cism. lessons from past crises suggest the need for more forceful and effective measures by the authorities to address and resolve weaknesses in the financial sector. proceed expeditiously with assessing ba nk viability and bank recapitalization. the long-term viability of institutions needs to be reevaluated to assess their capital needs, taking into account both a realisti c assessment of losses to date, and now, the prospects of further writedowns. in order to comprehend the order of magnitude of total capital needs of western banking systems, we have made two sets of illustrati ve calculations that fact or in potential further writedowns and revenues that these banks ma y experience in 2009–10. the calculations rely on several assumptions, some of which are quite uncertain , and so the capital needed by banks should be viewed as indicative of the severity of the probl em. the first calculation assumes that leverage, measured as tangible common equity (tce) over ta ngible assets (ta), retu rns to levels prevailing before the crisis (4 percent tce/ta). even to reach these levels, capital injections would need to be some $275 billion for u.s. banks, about $375 billion for euro area banks, about $125 billion for u.k. banks, and about $100 billion for banks in the re st of mature europe. the second illustrative calculation assumes a return of le verage to levels of the mid-1990s (6 percent tce/ta). this more demanding level raises the amount of capital to be injected to around $500 billion for u.s. banks, $725 billion for euro area banks, $250 billion for u.k. banks, and $225 billion for banks in the rest of mature europe. these rough estimate s, based on our scenarios, suggest that in addition to offsetting losses, the additional need for capi tal derives from the more stringent leverage and higher capital ratios markets are now demanding, based on the uncertainty surrounding asset valuations and the quality of capital. without making a judgment about the appropriaten ess of using the tce/ta ratio, it is important to note that these amounts are lessened to the degree that preferred equity is converted into common equity (generating more of the loss-absorbing type of capital) and to the degree that governments have guaranteed banks agai nst further losses of some of the bad assets on their balance sheets. in the united states, for inst ance, the amount of preferred shares issued in recent years is quite large and could help to raise the tce/ta ratios if converted. in several countries, governments have agr eed to take large proportions of the future losses incurred on selected sets of assets by some banks. thus, to stabilize the banking system and reduce this uncertainty, thr ee elements are needed: xiii ',\n",

              " '  executive summary manner. however, the use of different techniques between countries makes it all the more important that they coordinate the underlying principles to be applied when valuing the assets and determining the share of losses to be borne by the public sector. among the methods being used so far, the united kingdom has favored keeping the assets in the banks but providing guarantees that limit the impact of further losses. an alternative is to pl ace the bad assets in a se parate asset management company (amc) (a so-called “bad bank”), an appr oach that switzerland has adopted with ubs and that ireland is also pursuing. this latter approach has the advantage of bein g relatively transparent and, if the bulk of the bank’s bad assets are tran sferred to the amc, leaves the “good bank” with a clean balance sheet. the united st ates has provided a guarantee ag ainst a pool of assets that are either troubled or vulnerable to large losses in th e case of citibank and bank of america, as well as proposing to establish private/public partnerships to purchase impaired assets from banks. the current proposal has elements to encourage private sector participation, but it is not clear yet whether banks will have enough incentive to actually sell their impaired assets. in general, different approaches can work depending on country circumstances. moreover, since valuation issues remain an important source of uncertainty, governments need to establish methodologies for the realistic va luation of illiquid, securitized credit instruments that they intend to support. when assets are not traded regularly and their market prices are based on “fire sales,” valuation should be based on expected economic conditions to determine the net present value of future income streams. preferably, while recognizing the complexity of some of the assets, such a basic methodology should be agreed upon an d consistently applied across countries to avoid overly positive valuations, regulatory arbitrage, or competitive distortions . the financial stability board, working with standard setters, would be best placed to promote a coordinated approach. provide adequate liquidity to accompany bank restructuring. bank funding markets remain highly stressed and will only recover once counterparty risks lessen and banks and providers of wholesale market liquidity are more certain about how their funds are to be deployed. many govern ments have introduced measures to protect depositors and have guaranteed various forms of bank debt, but littl e longer-term funding is available without such government backstopping. even so, the wholesale funding gap remains large and the structure of national schemes could be made more consistent with each other to improve clarity and reduce frictions. as a result, central banks will need to continue to provide ample short-term liquidity to banks, and governments will need to provide liability guarantees, for the foreseeable future. however, it is not too early to c onsider exit policies, which in any case should be implemented gradually. such policies should aim to gradually repri ce the facilities and restrict the terms of their use so that there are incentives for banks to return to private markets.  * * * in addition to the three priorities concerning advanced countries’ banking sectors, other immediate policy measures are to address the spread of the crisis to emerging market countries and the risk of financial protectionism. assure that emerging market economies have adequate protection against the deleveraging and risk aversion of advanced economy investors. the problems of the advanced country banking sectors and the global contraction are now having severe effects on emerging market countries. we project annual cross-border portfolio outflows of around 1 percent of emerging mark et gdp over the next few years. under reasonable xv ',\n",
              " '  executive summary scenarios, private capital flows to emerging markets could see net outflows in 2009, with slim chances of a recovery in 2010 and 2011. as in advanced economies, emerging market central banks will need to assure adequate liquidity in their banking systems. however, in many cases the domestic interbank market is not a major source of funding, as much bank funding ha s been sourced externally in recent years. thus, central banks may well need to provide foreign cu rrency though swaps or outright sales. those central banks with large foreign exchange reserves can draw on this buffer, but other means, such as swap lines with advanced country cen tral banks or the use of imf facilities, should also be a line of defense. the greater resources available to the imf following the g-20 summit can help countries buffer the impact of the financial cr isis on real activity and, particul arly in the developing countries, limit the effect on the poor. moreover, imf programs can play a useful role in catalyzing support from others in some cases. the vast majority of the rollover risk in emerging market external debt is concentrated in the corporate sector. direct government support for corporate borrowing may be warranted. some countries have extended their guarantees of bank debt to corporates, focusing on those associated with export markets. some countries are providing backstops to trade finance through various facilities—helping to keep trade flowing and limit ing the damage to the real economy. even so, contingency plans should be devised in order to pr epare for potential large-scale restructurings in case circumstances deteriorate further. within europe, the strong cross-border dependen cies make it essential that authorities in both advanced and emerging countries work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. the recently issued report of the “de larosière group” provides a good start for discussing intraeuropean union coordination and cooperation. concerns over the rollover of maturing debt and the continued external financing of current account deficits in emerging europe require action. joint action is also needed to address banking system problems—including coordination on stress tests involving the parent and subsidiaries, better home /host cooperation, and data sharing—as well as preparations to deal with stresses arising from hou sehold and corporate debt service. in cases where western european banks have mu ltiple subsidiaries in emerging european countries, joint discussions among the relevant supervisors of how to deal with common predicaments would likely result in better outcom es for all parties. coordinate policies across countries to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor treatment. pressure to support domestic lending may lead to financial protectionism. when countries act unilaterally to support their own financ ial systems, there may be adverse consequences for other countries. in a number of countries, authorities have stated th at banks receiving support should maintain (or preferably expand) their domestic lending. this could crowd out foreig n lending as banks face ongoing pressure to delever their overall balance sheets, sell foreig n operations, and seek to remove their riskier assets, with damaging consequences for emerging market countries and hence for the wider global economy. at the same time, recent ag reements among the parents of banks in some countries to continue to supply their subsidiaries in host countries with credit are heartening. macroeconomic policy consistency and reinforcement in order to provide a foundation for a sustainabl e economic recovery, it is critical to stabilize the global financial system. as also noted in the april 2009 world economic outlook, policies aimed at the financial sector will also be more effective if they are reinforced by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies.  xvi ',\n",

              " 'setting the stage for a more robust global financial system the immediate priority of policymakers is to address the current crisis. at the same time, work is continuing to develop a more robust financial system for the longer term. in addition to providing for a more resilient and efficient financial system after th e crisis clears, a clear sense of direction about longer-term financ ial policies can also contribute to removing uncertainties and improving market confidence in the short term. while many of the propo sals below may appear conceptual, their implications are real. their pr oper implementation will requi re significant changes in structures and resources, while inte rnational consistency will be essential.3 there is little doubt that the crisis will re quire far-reaching changes in the shape and functioning of financial markets, an d that the financial system will be characterized by lower levels of leverage, reduced funding mismatches, less counte rparty risk, and more transparent and simpler financial instruments than the pre-crisis period. the private sector has a cen tral responsibility to contribute to this new environment by improving risk management, includin g through attention to governance and remuneration policies. since neither market discipline nor public oversight were sufficient to properly assess and contain the buildup of systemic risks, improv ed financial regulation and supervision are key components to preventing future crises. the empha sis should be on how to detect and mitigate systemic risks through better regulation. while attempts to eliminate all systemic risk would not only be impossible, but also would slow economic growth and constrain creativity and innovation, the cu rrent crisis demonstrates that greater emphasis should be placed on systemically focused surveilla nce and regulation. at the same time, a better macroprudential framework for monetary policy would also help to mitigate systemic risks. while we should strive for regulation that provides incentives for private institutions, wherever possible, to take actions that reinforce financial stability, we should recognize that system-wide stability is a public good that will be undervalued by private institutions and regulations will need to force systemically important firms to better internalize the overall societal costs of instability. for this to occur, the mandates of central banks, regulators , and supervisors should include financial stability. a clear framework to assess and act upon systemic risks will need to be in place, with a clear delineation of who is the lead systemic regulator. to be able to mitigate systemic risks, those risks will need to be better defined and measured. chapters 2 and 3 both shed light on various metrics to help identify systemically important institutions by observing both direct and indirect linkages. in some cases, the measures could be viewed as a starting point for the consideration of an additional capital surcharge that could be designed as a deterrent to firms becoming “too-c onnected-to-fail.” even if not formally used, the proposed measures could guide policymakers to limit the size of various risk exposures across institutions. clearly, such methods would require ve ry careful consideration and application in order to avoid outcomes whereby institutions find ot her means of taking prof itable exposures. more discussion and research is needed before regulations based on this work could be put into place. as regards regulatory reforms, we see five priority areas: extending the perimeter of regulation to cover all systemically important institutions and acti vities, preventing excessive leverage and reducing procyclicality, addr essing market discipline and information gaps, improving cross                         3for a set of recommendations along these lines, see the imf paper “lessons of the financial crisis for future regulation of financial institutions and markets and for liquidity management,” february 4, 2009. available via the internet: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/020409.pdf . xviii ',\n",
              " '  executive summary border and cross-functional regulati on, and strengthening systemic liquidity management. the main lessons can be summarized as follows. define systemically import ant institutions and the perimeter of prudential regulation. as recognized by the recent g-20 communiqué, this crisis has demonstrated that regulation needs to encompass all systemically important institutions. traditionally, only a core set of large banks has been regarded as syst emically relevant, but the crisis has shown that other nonbank financial intermediaries can be sy stemically important and their failu re can cause destabilizing effects. not only does an institution’s size matter for its systemic importance—its interconnectedness and the vulnerability of its business models to excess le verage or a risky funding structure matter as well.  in order to better capture systemic risks, regulation needs to be expanded to a wider range of institutions and markets. while certainly not all financial institutions need to be regulated, prudential supervision will need to cover some institutions th at had previously been viewed as outside the core institutions (e.g., investment banks). moreover, certain activities (such as credit derivatives and insurance) will need to be overseen by regulators regardless of the type of legal structure in which they are placed. a two-tiered approach may work best. a wider tier would be required to provide information from which supervisors would determin e which institutions are systemically important. the other tier would be a narrower—though wider th an at present—perimeter of more intensified prudential regulation and oversight that would incl ude all systemically important institutions. while these institutions would receive more intense scrutiny given their systemic importance, other institutions would continue to be overseen as part icipants in the payments or banking system or for consumer or investor protection purposes. chapte rs 2 and 3 provide methodologies that could be used to discern how close institutions are to each other and thus the contours of an inner tier. these methods will be further explored as the imf works toward a practical definition of a systemically important institution as requested by the g-20. prevent excessive leverage and curb procyclicality. new regulatory approaches are needed to av oid the buildup of systemic risk and the subsequent and difficult deleveraging process. finding solutions for how to limit leverage going forward and reduce the procyclical tendencies inherent in business practices and existing regulation remains challenging. regulation shou ld attempt to reinforce financia l institutions’ sound risk-based decision-making, whereas deterring risk-taking in the global economy would be unhelpful. regulation should provide incentives that support systemic stab ility, while discouraging regulatory arbitrage and short-termism, but the higher standards should be phased in gradually over time so that they do not exacerbate the present situation. capital regulation and accounti ng standards should include incentives and guidance that permit the accumulation of additiona l capital buffers during upswings when risks tend to accumulate and are typically underestimated. this would better reflect the risks through the cycle and thus add to capital and provisions that could be used to ab sorb losses during the downswings. ideally, these countercyclical capital requirement s would not be discretionary, but act as automatic stabilizers and be built into regulations. this would not limit the capacity of supervisors to act with supplementary measures if needed. an upper limit on leverage based on a simple measur e could be useful as a supplementary restriction to more robu st risk-weighted capital calculations. accounting rules and valuation practices should be strengthened to reflect a broader range of available information on the evolution of risks through the cycle. accounting standard setters and prudential authorities should collaborate to achi eve these objectives, with particular emphasis on enabling higher loan loss provisions during periods of rapid credit expansion, evaluating approaches xix ',\n",
