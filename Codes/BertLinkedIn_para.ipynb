              " 'Established in 2014, The Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is a collaboration among organisations including CDP, United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the We Mean Business Coalition. It assists global companies and financial institutions in setting science-based GHG emissions reduction targets, striving for ambitious corporate climate action. The SBTi mission involves aligning businesses with climate science, cutting emissions, and contributing to the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.  ',\n",
              " 'SBTi prioritises emission reduction, offering sector-specific guidance for high-emission industries and facilitating action in areas like maritime and aviation. Their approach aims to make ambitious climate action mainstream across sectors, urging the necessary transformations for a net-zero world. This includes collaboration with large companies and their supply chains. SBTi believes this multi-pronged approach will effectively accelerate private sector emissions reduction in harmony with the Paris Agreement.  ',\n",

',\n",
              " 'The data analysed in this report is up to date as of December 31, 2022. To ensure inclusiveness, information published after this date, as recent as June 2023, has been incorporated. These additional sources include company sustainability reports, corporate publications, and relevant non-financial reports accessible at the time of review.  ',\n",
              " \"1. The adoption of science-based targets surged in 2022, surpassing the combined figures of the previous seven years. A total of 1,097 companies had validated targets published, compared to 1,082 in the preceding seven years. With 587 targets established in 2021, there was an 87% year-on-year increase in validated targets. Commitments to set science-based targets also rose, with 1,287 companies committing to this within 24 months as per the SBTi's Commitment Compliance Policy. By the close of 2022, 2,079 companies had validated science-based targets, and an additional 2,151 companies committed to setting targets.  \",\n",
              " '2. Nearly all SBTi companies with targets are addressing scope 3 emissions. In 2022, 406 companies that set targets also included scope 3 targets. This raised the overall count of companies with science-based targets covering scope 3 (excluding SMEs and financial institutions) to 1,134, accounting for 96% by the end of 2022. Among companies that introduced scope 3 targets in 2022, 63 established supplier engagement targets, encouraging suppliers in their value chains to set their own science-based targets. Consequently, the total number of companies with supplier and customer engagement targets reached 189, equivalent to 16% of all companies with science-based targets by the conclusion of 2022.  ',\n",
              " \"3. Companies had their targets validated against the SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard for the first full year in 2022. The Net-Zero Standard, introduced in October 2021, represents SBTi's most ambitious decarbonisation level, necessitating both near and long-term science-based targets to achieve complete emissions reduction by 2050. Of the 130 organisations that established net-zero targets in 2022, 78 (60%) were categorised as companies, with the remaining 40% being SMEs. Additionally, 889 companies committed to presenting net-zero targets. These net-zero objectives constituted 12% of all science-based targets set in 2022.  \",\n",

              " '5. The cumulative scope 1 and 2 emissions from companies adopting science-based targets reached 422 million tonnes of CO2e by the end of 2022. This marked a significant upsurge of 27% compared to 2021 and exceeded the total greenhouse gas emissions of the UK for the same year. The combined scope 1 and 2 emissions addressed through science-based targets escalated nearly 15-fold from 145 million to two billion tonnes of CO2e between 2015 and 2022.  ',\n",

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is a vital platform for organisations to transparently share their environmental data, strategies, and commitments. However, successful CDP reporting requires a year-round strategic approach that goes beyond simply meeting July disclosure deadlines. ',\n",
              " 'This article delves into five crucial practices that sustainable businesses should adopt now to ensure effective CDP reporting while fostering long-term environmental stewardship. ',\n",
              " 'Many organisations only start their CDP reporting shortly prior to the deadline and treat the disclosure as a project, but CDP reporting is an integral component of a company’s sustainability strategy. Embedding CDP reporting as part of an ongoing program will ensure that you are checking in on post-CDP actions and laying the foundations for next year’s reporting. ',\n",
              " 'This approach not only bolsters the credibility of your reporting but also cultivates an internal “culture of sustainability” within the organisation. By consistently addressing environmental concerns throughout the year, companies can seamlessly integrate sustainability practices into their operations and prepare for subsequent reporting cycles with enhanced readiness and accuracy. ',\n",
              " \"As the importance of verified greenhouse gas (GHG) data continues to rise, third-party assurance of reported data becomes a key priority. Planning for assurance well in advance is critical. Aligning with third-party auditors' schedules and incorporating verification into the annual reporting cycle ensures a smoother process and minimises the risk of last-minute inconsistencies. \",\n",
              " 'This proactive approach boosts transparency, instils investor confidence, and reinforces your commitment to accurate reporting, meeting both regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations. ',\n",
              " 'Establishing a clear approval and sign-off process at the outset of your sustainability program is crucial. Defining stakeholders responsible for providing approvals ensures they understand the time required to align with the CDP reporting deadline. Transparent communication regarding timelines and necessary inputs minimises delays and misunderstandings. ',\n",
              " 'By facilitating a well-structured approval process, organisations can streamline reporting procedures, allowing for more efficient data aggregation, and ensuring that the final submission accurately represents their sustainability endeavours. ',\n",
              " 'Understanding your data coverage, particularly concerning Scope 3 emissions, is paramount for comprehensive CDP reporting. Conducting an in-depth analysis post-CDP submission can reveal potential gaps in material categories where data might be lacking. Identifying these gaps ahead of time enables engagement with relevant departments to gather essential information. ',\n",
              " 'This approach ensures a complete representation of sustainability efforts, highlighting accomplishments in emissions reduction and resource conservation across all relevant areas. ',\n",
              " \"Making significant commitments, such as science-based targets and carbon transition plans, demands thorough planning and alignment. These commitments often need months of defining, stakeholder engagement, and internal approval processes. Identifying the support required, both internally and externally in advance, assists the clear definition and approval of commitments well before the CDP reporting deadline. This proactive strategy ensures that commitments reflect your organisation's sustainability strategy. \",\n",
              " \"By incorporating these five practices into their sustainability strategies, businesses can go beyond meeting the CDP reporting requirements. Proactive planning, ongoing momentum, data assurance, streamlined approval processes, and comprehensive data coverage all contribute to a holistic and accurate representation of an organization's commitment to sustainability. \",\n",

              " \"Sophistication - ESG raters and rankers typically use sophisticated methods to assess companies' sustainability performance, drawing on a wide range of data sources and research that can provide meaningful insights into risk and opportunities.Leadership buy-in/push - Companies may find that ESG raters and rankers can help build executive support for sustainability goals and initiatives in efforts to improve ratings and stakeholder perceptions. \",\n",
              " 'Disadvantages: ',\n",
              " \"‘Check the box’ exercise (reporting for reporting’s sake) -ESG disclosure has the risk of becoming a box-ticking exercise, rather than a meaningful effort to drive progress on sustainability.Resource allocation - Responding to ESG raters and rankers can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process for companies, particularly for smaller organisations or those with limited sustainability teams. With resources spent on disclosure, there can be little left over for implementing processes that drive sustainability.Scores that doesn’t reflect actual progress - ESG scores may not always accurately reflect a company's actual sustainability performance, and there is a risk that companies may selectively disclose information to improve their scores. \",\n",
              " 'Materiality assessments help bridge the gap between disclosure and impact in that they help inform organizations on which topics have impact and also what is important to the company’s stakeholders and investors.

              " \"One potential drawback of relying too heavily on ESG raters and rankers is that it can sometimes detract from the importance of storytelling in sustainability reporting.

              " 'One key consideration in sustainability reporting is the tension between striving for perfection and focusing on progress.

              " 'It was highlighted that spend-based calculations for Scope 3 emissions present challenges and limitations. While it may be a good starting point, companies should aim to focus on primary data as they progress further in their sustainability reporting journey. Without primary data, the emissions of the supplier will be viewed as standard for that category, and any innovations or emissions reductions progress they have made will not be captured.  ',\n",
              " \"Many manufacturing companies and those that sell products in the market are placing a significant focus on life cycle analysis (LCA) and sold-product emissions. However, it's worth noting that many and organisations are still figuring out the optimal approach. Open-source LCA sites were mentioned as helpful, but if your organisation has the resources, conducting an LCA on your own products is more beneficial. Similar to the spend-based approach for suppliers, having primary data for your products is crucial, and you can then fill in any gaps as needed. \",\n",
              " \"As mentioned, sustainability professionals are still grappling with how best to calculate Scope 3 emissions. As such, it's important to get comfortable with restatements and prepare leadership for them.

It is essential to take immediate and decisive action to reduce emissions across all sectors, including transportation, energy production, and agriculture. The findings of the report reinforce the need for global cooperation and decisive action to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change and protect our planet's future. The window of opportunity to take meaningful action is rapidly closing, and it is crucial that we act now to create a more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come. \",\n",
              " 'The burning of fossil fuels, coupled with unsustainable energy and land use, has led to a global warming of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. This increase in temperature has resulted in more frequent and intense extreme weather events, leading to increasingly dangerous impacts on both nature and people in every region of the world. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and include rising sea levels, more severe droughts, and devastating wildfires, among other things. The urgent need to transition away from high polluting energy and fuel cannot be overstated, as the continued use of unsustainable practices will only exacerbate these problems. We must view the transition to decarbonised forms of energy not only as a positive but an urgent necessity. ',\n",
              " \"Climate justice is a critical issue, as those who have contributed the least to climate change are being impacted the most. Additionally, nearly half of the world's population lives in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change, which only exacerbates the issue. The key to solving this problem lies in climate-resilient development, which involves incorporating measures to adapt to climate change while simultaneously working to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions in ways that provide broader benefits. Climate-resilient development is crucial as it helps communities to better prepare for and withstand the effects of climate change while simultaneously working towards a more sustainable future. \",\n",
              " \"Political commitment, coordinated policies, international cooperation, ecosystem stewardship, and inclusive governance are all crucial for achieving effective and equitable climate action. To combat climate change, it is essential to implement policies that promote sustainable development, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural ecosystems. International cooperation is vital to ensure that all countries work together towards a common goal. Additionally, ecosystem stewardship, including the conservation of approximately 30-50% of the Earth's land, freshwater, and oceans, is crucial for ensuring a healthy planet. This requires inclusive governance that ensures the participation of all stakeholders, including local communities and indigenous peoples.

Many companies are still developing their climate change strategies and reporting to CDP is an important catalyst to help drive a company’s ongoing journey forward.

Below we have highlighted five key ESG reporting trends to look out for in 2023. ',\n",
              " 'For businesses, mandatory regulation on ESG reporting is coming in thick and fast, both in the EU and in the United States. ',\n",
              " 'In the EU, the\\xa0Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)\\xa0is the latest EU Regulation regarding ESG and non-financial reporting, aiming to speed up EU progress on reaching Net-Zero. It is a step up from the current EU Regulation the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), expanding the number of mandatory reporting companies from 11,600 to around 49,000. ',\n",
              " 'The US is poised for regulation too. The\\xa0Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed mandatory climate-risk disclosure rule\\xa0will launch in 2023 if approved. In March 2022, the SEC released a new proposal for public companies to begin reporting their carbon emissions and reductions progress alongside their financial results. It requires all filers to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions that occur onsite and are controlled by the company. ',\n",
              " 'As ESG performance becomes a greater focus in the boardroom, companies are having to consider how best to hold themselves accountable. One way to accomplish this is to tie leaders’ compensation to positive ESG outcomes. Companies are increasingly including ESG metrics of some type in their incentive compensation schemes for top executives. ',\n",
              " 'In some companies, ESG and sustainability responsibility lies with the full board. Others assign diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I) and human capital management issues to the human resources committee and sustainability oversight to audit or governance committees. The exact assignments will vary with each company’s specific needs and culture, but it is becoming critical to assign accountability and ensure sufficient governance oversight within a board. ',\n",
              " 'Corporate board demographics are changing too. Companies are now looking to assemble boards for ‘tomorrow’, today. For example, recruiting ESG expertise on the board has become critical and hiring has a DE&amp;I lens now more than ever. ',\n",
              " 'At the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP) in 2022, there was an emerging theme of natural capital and the need to prioritise the preservation of biodiversity. The risks resulting from a loss of nature and changes to natural capital have the potential to disrupt society and the stability of the global economy. Whilst most research on financial risks related to natural capital has historically focused on climate change, there is a growing awareness of the risks associated with other aspects of natural capital, such as water stresses, resource scarcity and the loss of biodiversity. ',\n",
              " 'Biodiversity-related corporate reporting\\xa0is a fast-moving, developing area, and there is ongoing work to create harmonisation, particularly related to measurement and disclosure. Companies should not wait for globally agreed frameworks or perfect tools to be available to approach the topic of biodiversity and nature. Companies should begin to understand and manage biodiversity and nature-related risk and opportunities and to prepare to respond to the introduction of frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). ',\n",
              " 'With more regulation and investor pressure, there is no doubt that companies will need a process to produce high-quality, defensible ESG data that is more aligned with financial reporting requirements. ',\n",
              " 'For investors, a company’s ESG performance is only as good as its data quality. Bad quality data can result in inaccurate reporting, lack of transparency, and potential backlash from stakeholders if your efforts are deemed unreliable. Demanding data transparency is the way investors can ensure that the ESG information provided is accurate and not misleading. ',\n",
              " 'Advances in technology and software solutions to enable in-depth ESG data analysis are increasing the expectations for ESG data quality and transparency. Once good quality primary data is collected, software solutions enable ESG performance data to be aggregated, compared and benchmarked across various global metrics, KPIs and frameworks.  ',\n",
              " 'The reporting of Scope 3 emissions (GHG emissions that are not produced directly from the reporting company but from the activities of its value chain), will continue to rise, and will continue to be a challenging area for many. Communication, collaboration and shared-goals are key to achieving successful Scope 3 disclosure. However, even if you have a high level of buy-in both up and down the value chain, there are still complexities around the data itself and the methodologies used to calculate emissions. ',\n",
              " 'Leveraging Scope 3 resources to understand where your material impacts lie, where to start with data collection and how to focus on data quality and coverage over time, will ensure that a journey to reliable Scope 3 data is followed. ',\n",
              " 'In summary, what does this mean for businesses and ESG-focused investors? For both groups, requirements to collect, assess and report quality primary ESG data will continue to grow in 2023 and beyond so now is the time to ensure you have future-proof data management processes in place. As the ESG and sustainability reporting landscape grows in complexity and becomes increasingly mainstream, there is a real opportunity for business to improve transparency and demonstrate leadership.

Co-hosted with PRI, the Responsible Investment Forum is the longest-running private equity (PE) event focused on bringing together fund managers, institutional investors, and expert advisors to discuss ESG issues across alternative asset classes. ',\n",
              " 'Below we identify four key themes during the event: ',\n",
              " 'ESG continues to be high on the agenda for PE markets. Many general partners (GPs) are increasingly subject to higher scrutiny and regulatory compliance in an ever-evolving landscape. There is now much more emphasis on creating value through ESG performance, and a step away from the notion of ‘not doing harm’. ',\n",
              " 'Although PE firms are uniquely placed to realise ESG opportunities as a key value creation driver, the journey can be challenging and complex. The multiplicity of ESG frameworks, and obtaining reliable data to track performance, remain a challenge. However, as the industry matures, tools are being developed and ‘preferred’ frameworks are being adopted to align expectations. ',\n",
              " 'GPs can protect and create long-term value by enhancing value levers and integrating ESG into their value creation plans. Measuring performance against targets and building the knowledge and technology to support and improve those KPIs are key to the success, and sustaining asset value. ',\n",
              " 'A growing number of firms are developing decarbonisation strategies and many have set net-zero commitments and science-based targets across their portfolio. For these firms, defining a decarbonisation strategy is the most important starting point. Such a strategy typically involves setting out the overarching ambition and articulating carbon reduction targets, which can be broken down into short- and long-term measures. It is critical to align these targets with the firm’s overall ESG and fund strategy, serving as a guide for limited partners (LPS) and the investment team. ',\n",
              " 'However, setting realistic and achievable targets requires accurate measurement of primary data. This requires a streamlined approach to data collection and analysis, as well as portfolio engagement and education. PE firms need to truly engage with their portfolio companies’ management teams and set a clear roadmap. With active engagement at portfolio level, LPs can ensure that these portfolio companies feel part of their investor’s decarbonisation journey and understand what is expected of them year-on-year. ',\n",
              " 'Accurate and reliable ESG data is crucial to ensuring firms achieve their targets and create value. This not only relates to decarbonisation and the need for accurate emissions data, but is also true for the entire ESG spectrum. Primary data, sourced directly from portfolio companies, is how reliable value creation can be achieved. Anything else: secondary, or tertiary publicly available data, won’t stand up to scrutiny when it comes to monitoring the progress of targets and performance over time. ',\n",
              " 'To report robust and relevant data, LPs need to consider implementing a data strategy that future-proofs their reporting objectives. Embedding a data strategy will enable organisations to define a clear path for data management, facilitate reporting resilience, engage stakeholders, embrace technology and balance short- and long-term reporting effectively. ',\n",
              " 'As with any data request, it is essential to communicate what is required clearly but also expand on the when, how and why. Portfolio companies will look to investors for guidance on what is required today, but they also need to understand the context of the broader journey. For many privately held companies, they may not have been required to report on environmental or carbon data previously and as such, an educational element to their engagement is important. ',\n",
              " 'A challenge within the PE industry is the concept of letting perfection get in the way of progress. Stakeholders need to understand that perfection isn’t achieved overnight. ',\n",
              " 'ESG data is a great starting point and it’s important to have a baseline in order to monitor progress but we’re already seeing signs of ‘greenhushing’ where companies choose to keep their efforts quiet for fear of being accused of greenwashing. While there is a place for blatant greenwashing being exposed, more needs to be done to encourage companies to do their best to improve. ',\n",
              " 'ESG and sustainability reporting is a journey and the key to success is measurement of progress and stakeholder buy-in. CEOs and Boards need to be genuinely committed to the goals and need to be educated and informed at every step of the way. ',\n",
              " 'ESG software is the obvious way to streamline the ESG data collection, questionnaire distribution and management process.

By the end of the conference, the first-ever global agreement calling for climate reparations was established. The specifics of how this fund will operate will be laid out at COP28 next year in the United Arab Emirates. When diving into the text in detail, activists note the inclusion of “low-emission” energy as part of the solution. Some may worry this provides a loophole for natural gas and nuclear energy to continue to grow. Nevertheless, the creation of this agreement is a landmark achievement and will result in significant climate-dedicated cash flows to vulnerable nations. ',\n",

This agreement could open novel markets for companies in infrastructure, manufacturing, capital goods, and more for expansion and business development. With large sums of cash flowing to previously underfunded regions, companies may find new opportunities in regions not previously anticipated. ',\n",
              " 'On Tuesday, November 8th, the UN released a report about greenwashing and its widespread impacts on successful climate action. The UN provides a list of recommendations to ensure developed net zero pledges do not fall for greenwashing pitfalls. An example of one recommendation is the need to establish short- and medium-term absolute emissions reduction targets in addition to ones focused on the long term. Without targets for varying timelines, it is easy to develop unachievable long-term goals. Incremental work ensures companies and local governments continue to push themselves and do not forget about their plans for too long. ',\n",
              " 'The release of this report is a reminder that successful climate action requires reliable data to develop reliable plans and set realistic targets. Unreliable data and unrealistic goals provide short-sighted benefits but are extremely detrimental in the long term as companies and local governments try to undo false promises. Only those with legitimate emissions reductions will get to benefit from the positive publicity as governments crack down on greenwashing. Greenwashing is unlikely to be fully quashed any time soon, but in light of COP27, we suggest reviewing your climate goals to ensure they are ambitious but achievable to prevent false promises down the line.

The IMF says that the carbon price must go up to at least $75/ton by 2030 for global climate goals to succeed. Timely for the European Union, they already established a benchmark price at about 76 euros/tonne. However, the EU is unique in its resolve as the US state of California has carbon allowances selling for just under $30/tonne and many regions have yet to establish a price at all. ',\n",
              " 'A carbon price can be established in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. Although different in their design and implementation, both follow a structure that forces the original polluter to pay. Businesses that do not reduce their carbon emissions will feel the financial consequences as more regions implement these systems. Getting ahead of regulation is a smart strategy to prevent headaches and unnecessary taxes in the future. We recommend beginning the greenhouse gas accounting journey to start reducing emissions in advance of expensive regulation. ',\n",
              " 'During Finance Day, John F. Kerry, the White House climate envoy, outlined the USA’s carbon trading scheme. The voluntary plan aims to expand the sale of carbon credits globally to help boost renewable energy implementation in developing countries. The “Energy Transition Accelerator” will allow companies to claim credits for decarbonisation projects outside national borders and within developing countries. ',\n",
              " 'While the plan faced some backlash, its implementation could open opportunities for US companies to focus on clean energy as a means to offset necessary emissions of operations. Broadening beyond the US’s scheme, this COP saw a rise in the legitimacy of offsets. Offsets were pushed aside in past years to focus on other strategies. However, people noted a significant increase in offset conversations throughout COP27. Offset and renewable energy projects can help offset a company’s internal emissions or be sold to other organisations falling short. ',\n",

              " 'With reporting requirements constantly increasing, a huge volume of data needs to be collected and reported across an organisation. Once collected, you are then faced with the daunting task of combining datasets from different business functions into something that can be interpreted, analysed and reported on. ',\n",
              " 'As data gets more complex, using spreadsheets becomes cumbersome and there is a point where spreadsheets simply cannot handle the volume of data you need to report as part of your sustainability and ESG strategy. ',\n",
              " 'Greenstone, through its award-winning sustainability and ESG software, enables its clients to move away from spreadsheet outputs and time-consuming data collection; to in-depth reporting and analysis and real decision-making. Based on our experience of helping our clients do this, below we have outlined five reasons why spreadsheets are not fit to manage your sustainability data. ',\n",
              " 'It is likely that you will be dealing with large volumes of sustainability and ESG data collected from a long list of sources across your organisation. Putting all this data into a single spreadsheet can be a problem as Excel struggles with large file sizes. Whilst you can enter large volumes of data into Excel, you will find yourself waiting for ages for it to perform even the simplest calculations and the files can be unstable and can easily crash. ',\n",
              " 'Another factor that will affect the performance of your spreadsheet is the number of formulas and conditional formatting you use. As the complexity of your sustainability and ESG reporting increases with larger and larger datasets, you will find your formula-rich spreadsheets performing very slowly and eventually crashing. ',\n",
              " 'One of the most limiting factors when using spreadsheets to manage your sustainability and ESG data is the lack of multiple user access options. Excel was never built for multiple users and even with modern versions, it is completely impractical to have more than a limited number of users access a spreadsheet at once. Even with a small number of users accessing a single file at one time, there is an increased danger of data loss. ',\n",
              " 'Excel can produce a number of reports, graphs and charts but they are limited and can easily become detached from automatic updates without clear indication. Sustainability and ESG software can automatically produce reports for internal reporting purposes, as well as global ESG and sustainability reporting frameworks e.g. CDP, GRI, SASB, TCFD, DJSI and ISO, at the click of a button. ',\n",
              " 'The same goes for dashboards; Excel doesn’t come with dashboards, whereas sustainability management software comes packed with a variety of intuitive and customisable dashboards that multiple stakeholders within an organisation, whether software users or not, can access and easily understand. ',\n",
              " 'Excel spreadsheets are inherently more unstable compared to other software solutions, so there is a much higher likelihood of data corruption. This can pose a serious risk if you are reliant on Excel as your main data calculation tool, even if you do create regular backups. Software-as-a-Service provides daily customer data backups and offsite storage in secure locations for longer retention. ',\n",
              " 'Purpose-built sustainability management software is designed to be used for managing sustainability and ESG data and therefore the functionality tends to be intuitive, built for purpose and easy to use. Examples of this include industry-specific calculations, such as parallel GHG calculations across location-based, residual-mix and market-based emissions reporting coming as standard functionality. In Excel, you’ll have to build all this functionality into your spreadsheet yourself, which can take quite a lot of work and a good degree of training to use. ',\n",

              " 'As a result of their ESG initiatives, 55% of supply chain executives say they expect to see better management of operational risks within the next one to three years, adding to the 20% who have already seen these reductions. ',\n",
              " 'While 31% have already experienced enhanced efficiency and productivity, 51% expect to see that in the next one to three years. In the longer term, three to five years, 54% of respondents expect increased share price or other indicators of shareholder value. ',\n",

',\n",
              " 'Where to start: ',\n",
              " 'One of the most common questions asked by organisations engaging their suppliers for the first time, is “who should I target?”. Well firstly, it is worth reviewing and understanding your supplier list. It can become apparent with a deeper look that a supplier list is not up to date and accurate, many listed suppliers are no longer suppliers and from our experience, the actual list is anywhere between 40 – 70 % smaller. This makes an enormous difference when planning your approach, as we would always argue that from a risk perspective you need almost the entire supplier coverage. ',\n",

              " 'We have multiple clients who distribute their supplier code of conduct through SupplierPortal. These are mandated for all suppliers, and so there is really no reason why you should not be looking to achieve basic compliance across all of your suppliers. Sadly, the risk to your business is unlikely to conveniently sit within 20% of suppliers that represent 80% of your spending. Therefore, you need to avoid a lack of meaningful coverage, and if you do try a different approach then don’t take a simple cross-section of suppliers but apply geographical, legislative and spend filters to identify ‘high’ risk suppliers. Always think is your approach well thought through and defensible to an auditor. ',\n",
